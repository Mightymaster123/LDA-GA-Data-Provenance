bad astronomy tabby’s star sorry folks isn’t aliens hoping aliens sadly observations tabby star show weird dips light gigantic megastructures built advanced aliens power space based civilization dust don despair plenty mystery dust coming contenders um place hang tight ll thatok scoop tabby star aka kic star light years f3 main sequence star means stable star fusing hydrogen helium core massive bigger hotter sun luminosity amount energy emits times sun humdrum galactic news cycle stars milky thing undergoes extreme dips brightness earth dips percent total light february star dimmed lot dips bit weird rules big thing planet orbiting periodically blocking light knew huge object block star half size star make object star evidence thing idea family comets technically orbit star exocomets orbiting tabby star breaking expanding dust cloud creating dips hard block light needed observations star made colors wavelength dependency dips lot causing dips discovered kepler space telescope data
