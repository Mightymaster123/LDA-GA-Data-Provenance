marchas estudiantiles lo esas sino casi todas las marchas en nuestro pais provocan al final caos desorden quizas por parte de las personas creen en la razon de la marcha pero si por otros se aprobechan de dichas circunstancias para hacer destrozos importa repitan una imagen al fin igual muestran parte de la realidad creo aqu mismo se busca crear mas odio resentimiento por cosas tontas sencillas asuman las marchas producen estragos por muy buenas sean las intenciones de quienes las crean el caos tambien forma parte de la noticia al final son acaso nuestras propias cosas las son destruidas posterior ellas pucha ale importa repitan una imagen porque se condice con los preceptos de la tica period stica eso es lo explica esta nota deber de leerla bien por lo dem creo es pedir mucho las noticias de pa muestren toda la realidad solo parte de ella con el fin de dar conocer toas las faceta de este movimiento solo aquellas puedan beneficiar perjudicar unos por sobre otros espec ficamente en tu caso ale imaginaria alguien como tu deber con mas raz exigir una mejora en la educaci de esa forma tu hijos ya sea existentes futuros podr corregir su padre madre dado la ambig edad la

consuelo saavedra amaro gomez pablos est acorralados por su trabajo es justo pensar ellos pretenden tergiversar los hechos doy fe de haber visto muchas veces los comentarios expl citos de ambos periodistas recalcando las manifestaciones organizadas pac ficas justas llevamos en las causas en contra de hidroays favor de la educaci en nuestro pa incluso en sus comentarios de radio amaro tambi

desmanes ponen esa foto hab fijado hasta le esto eso se denuncia la cntv cierto asco eso es lo dan todos los noticiarios de la tv chilena el canal de todos los chilenos el se sostiene de nuestros

existan flaites encuentran nada mejor destruir cosas ajenas es una muestra de la sima educaci existe para la gente pobre eso se debe cambiar por mi los carabineros deber intentar aislar los focos de destrucci del resto de la marcha agarrar todos esos agitadores en vez de corretearlos para se mezclen con los dem poder tener una excusa para poder irse contra la marcha en causando destrozos extra de por medio como vi hac en la marcha pasada tvn siempre ha sido medio utiliza el gobiernos con esto digo todos para manipular la opini blica para desviar la atenci como en la antigua roma pan circo es obvio la tele incluido las noticias miente con tal de tener publicidad pues la verdad aburre las tragedias son interesante seg ellos claro para eso tenemos internet espacio libre porque solamente hay tragedias tambi pasan cosas muy buenas pero lo van colocar como reportaje de minutos pero el problema es como sacarle eso las personas pica frase el pa est malo es una desgracia el presidente pi era

valparaiso fm noticias blog archive el encapuchado de tvnexiste concepto en comunicaciones es esesinato de imagen creo ese recurso encaja en el esquema de las movilizacionesok las protestas se grafican con una sola imagen queda claro quiz es poco tico pero lo tienen reconocer es siempre hay protesta de estudiantes queda la grande hay desmanes hay destrozos la gente est metida en esto tiene por pagar sus destrozos son bien poco mujercitas hombrecitos para reconocer tambi sus errores tengan presente los bienes de uso blico est ah con el dinero de todos los chilenos vengan mi con cuentos ac precisamente en mi ciudad estudiantes se tomaron sus liceos rompieron inmobiliario robaron inmobiliario hasta robaron los mismos computadores usan para sus clases hay muchos simos est ni ah con el tema de la educaci justa lo quieren darse unas vacaciones saquear romper todo lo puedan ahora tambi es bien cil hablar del gobierno de pi era proponer serias reformas contitucionales la concertaci tuvo os para solucionarles el problemita ah est culpemos al gobierno actual hay reformas duran os si si eso es lo les entra es proceso lento es una seguidilla de malas decisiones tiene ver fundamentalmente con el gobierno de la concertaci espero tomen con altura de miras estas cr ticas ya por lo veo aceptan cr ticas ustedes al parecer son due os de la raz siempre con bases alumnos provocan destrozos liceohttp www ovallehoy cl municipio de coquimbo presenta querella por destrozos en el liceo de tierras blancas htmly es el nico liceo hay saber reconocer los errores consta ac

conviene apelan al codigo de tica qu verg enza el periodismo de hoy necesitan reinventarse en serio otra vez se ve reflejado como las marionetas algunos periodistas son manipulados por manos maestras con el unico fin de generar dinero pasando por alto principios basicos de todo oficio profesion la etica es de asombrar una jugarreta asi de este canal de todos los corruptos solo basta con ver la calidad de programas tienen aporte la cultura el fuego os purge herejes pingback tvn su encapuchado favoritoconforme al ltimo rrafo del cntv cabe se alar jam en ning caso ha sido ente pertinente en rminos de verdadera regulaci ela televisi reciban una otra demanda de contenidos por parte de los televidentes significa nada el cntv es grupo de pol ticos con intereses creados sus decisiones tienen ning aporte han permitido el nacimiento serio de nuevas opciones de televisi local siempre han privilegiado las grandes cadenas incluso hace os atr le han dado todas las pasadas pi era para gane concesiones de chilevisi en casi todo el pa le fue muy til en su campa donde ahora vemos las consecuencias el cntv debe estar formado por audiovisualistas cnicos expertos creadores en fin representatividad ahora gracias este ente falso tenemos la misma televisi en todos los canales los mismos programas pero con distinto nombre las mismas im genes pero con distinto logo son unos abusadores se prestan para este tipo de cosas se les vaya ocurrir confiar en el cntv si eso muestra algo representar preguntale la gente vive los alrededores de plaz italia cual es la imagen de esas noticias adem del encapuchado agregar autos destrozados negocios robados ni hablar de los destrozos con qu cara critican la imagen de una noticia llega siempre lo mismo la cultura educaci comienza por casa demuestran nada lo contrario estimada yas parece super irresponsable tu declaraci como ciudadana como persona ajena al movimiento seg deduzco de tus palabras el hecho de en cada manifestacion al menos santiaguina termine con destrozos da derecho generalizar todo pais hoy se moviliza caes en lo mismo tvn est haciendo vendiendo lo suena tal como tu concuerdo con este problema desde os atr mas decir hace os lo correcto es el problema comienza durante la dictadura para ser mas especifico desde ah la historia cambia ahora os estuvo la concerta calentando los huevos de oro sus reformas actitudes pol ticas totalmente erradas poco honestas se contin con el gobierno de turno lo hace hoy tu gobierno el de todos es mas hacer explotar la olla hoy vemos las consecuencias el hecho de entrar con soberbia ambici ha sido su mejor ctica para demostrar los cambios tanto pregonaron vendieron como podemos destrozar la concerta con sus promesas buscando material todos los podemos hacer notar las mentiras prometidas de parte de nuestro querido presidente don sebastian pi era en mi opini el deber estar tras las rejas hizo lo mismo hizo la polar en este tiempo en fin el llamado de atencion va hacia toda clase pol tica hacia todos aquellos ciudadanos chilenos se sienten ajenos este movimiento social por nuestra educaci quien se manifieste por algo tan trascendental como es la educacion de pa es preocupante pues esto marca la diferencia entre los paises desarrollados los aun lo est quien tiene educaci tiene mejor calidad de vida salud mayor expectativa de vida como ven en chile prima otra cosa el mercado el trabajo el ganar plata para ser feliz peor aun para vivir es menester de cada uno evaluar cual es el sentido pa cada uno quiere analizar la forma en nosotros hoy aportamos nuestro granito de arena en cambiar la realidad tenemos de ser seguiremos con la actitud chilensis muy bien llamada chilenos mojigatos pacatos basta de conformismo esto es deber de todos hace unos os recuerdo en qu canal mostraban im genes de una toma en la sede de utem de salvador como si correspondiese la de dieciocho im genes hab visto anteriormente eran de archivo eran mostradas como si fuesen situ ni siquiera correspond el lugar la verdad sorprende dadas las pr cticas en ha incurrido el periodismo chileno prop sito de los movimientos estudiantes ahora sorprenda quiere decir est mal

crimen los demonizas trav de la violencia el desprestigio la descalificaci hasta una mentira la transformas en verdad ya preparado el camino para destruir ase la historia de la aniquilaci de los indios de los negros de los jud os de la guerra de irak pero ahora es tan cil nos podemos defender ya nos es posible mentir descaradamente los periodistas voceros de los diarios de la tv dejaron de
