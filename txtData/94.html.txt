saying that the journalists tried to influence the judiciary through their editorials the case was sent to the court of appeals the nationalist lawyers unity association asked the court to bring the case against the four journalists who face jail terms of nine months to 4 years if convicted  the case has been opened because dink and the other writers of the armenian agos publication have

and human rights was held afp worded this differently in his last column for agos dink complained that he had become famous as an enemy of turks and wrote of threats against him he said he had received no protection from authorities despite his complaints  my computer s memory is loaded with sentences full of hatred and threats dink wrote i do not know how real these threats are but what s really unbearable is the psychological torture that i m living in i am just like a pigeon i look around to my left and right in front and behind me as much as it does my head is just as active but i also know that in this country they love pigeons and do not shoot them unfortunately some extremist nationalists have proven him to be false dink ended his last column by predicting that 2007 would be

dink s funeral procession for saying we are all armenian claiming that this is contrary to article 301  it is shocking but not surprising said raffi hamparian of the armenian national committee of america the nation s largest armenian american political organization we are paying the results of a tragic policy on the part of turkey to deny its past and perhaps most tragically the complicity of the u s in this denial la times jan 20 2 february 2007 the turkish left magazine which had nominated hrant dink in 6th place for the fascists of the year in 2006 continues to publish although the campaign is subject of a court case the same magazine continues to publish articles which show that it is not disturbed by the murder in an article by g kce firat entitled turkey has lost an enemy it says dink does not become a martyr of the press or of democracy because he was murdered when he was alive he was an enemy of turks and turkey who defended the armenian theses against this country 4

2007 after the website of the pelitlispor football club in trabzon had published messages supporting the murders of hrant dink and priest santoro support for the murder of three christians in malatya on 18 april 2007 becomes apparent at a malatyaspor website the pelitlispor internet site also speaks of the killers in malatya as the malatya knights hrant dink december 13 2005europe and turkey are locked in a relationship of mutual fear and suppressed desire it will be opened when turkey can face its greatest taboo says the editor of the armenian newspaper agos in istanbul hrant dink the interest of foreign journalists politicians and intellectuals in turkey is more intense than ever their opening inquiries are clear and strong where is turkey going will nationalism increase if it does to what kind of a regime can turkey slide then comes a special question the one that people like me a turkish citizen and an armenian can always expect are you minorities afraid of the way things are going it is striking that those looking at turkey from the outside are much more impatient eager for quick answers and solutions than those on the inside to what degree is this impatience realistic after all throughout the period of the modern republic since 1923 turkey is a country where changes have been dictated from top to bottom and thus one where inner dynamics from bottom to top are not easily activated turkish society is far more used to accepting change allowing it to happen than to initiating it this consistent structural character has allowed the deep state the network of military and security forces that exercises real political control in turkey to survive the three major international developments influencing the country in recent decades first the cold war years of conflict 1940s 1980s between the united states led capitalist world and the soviet union led socialist world this external dynamic favoured the emergence of a radical social left in turkey but the state s preference for western capitalism aided by successive military coups d tat crushed the left s challenge before it could become too powerful second the mullahs revolution in iran 1979 this external dynamic too had a harsh effect on turkey those in power instinctively saw its influence among religious muslims in turkey as equivalent to the demand for a change of regime and thus something to be opposed by all means third the european union 1960s 2000s this outer dynamic is very different in its impact on turkey than the first two the main reason is that the eu finds nearly all elements of turkish society and its institutions divided against itself on the issue political left and right secular and religious nationalist and liberal state bureaucracy and military the situation is the same in that everywhere there are internal conflicts over europe at least as much as conflicts between the camps since no part of turkish society is homogeneously for or against the european union the eu process has had a singular effect dissolving turkey s existing polarisations and becoming itself the main inner dynamic of turkish development as the negotiations for turkey s accession to the eu continue over the next decade this dilemma will increasingly constitute the basis of turkish politics every change experienced in the near future will touch the skin of nearly every section of society creating widespread friction and probably a lot of annoyance from the inside therefore the questions facing turkey are different from those posed by outsiders how can the oligarchic state so accustomed to holding power consent to share its sovereignty as a member of the european union why is it so desperate to abandon the world it knows for an unknown future in europe is it the desire to be western or the fear of remaining eastern the great taboobut the questions are not all one way when the european union is asked why it wishes to include turkey with its lower economic and democratic standards the answer suggests an uncomfortable truth that the relationship between turkey and the eu is governed less by reciprocal desire than by fear the military elite of the turkish republic probably calculates that a turkey unable to enter the european union is in danger of becoming a strategical irrelevance while the european union s power brokers must consider that a turkey remaining outside of europe might become a combatant on the other side of a clash of civilisations as long as the engine of fear pushing from the back is stronger than the engine of desire pulling from the front the dynamics of turkish european union relations will be uneasy and contested on all sides not just in turkey where fear is dominant it produces symptoms of resistance to change at all levels of society the more some people yearn and work for openness and enlightenment the more others who are afraid of such changes struggle to keep society closed in turkey the legal cases against hrant dink orhan pamuk ragip zarakolu or murat belge are examples of how the breaking of every taboo causes panic in the end this is especially true of the armenian issue the greatest of all taboos in turkey one that was present at the creation of the state and which represents the principal other of turkish national identity in this atmosphere a guiding watchword can be found in the first words of our national anthem indeed i concluded my presentation to the conference at bilgi university istanbul on ottoman armenians during the decline of the empire issues of scientific responsibility and democracy on 24 25 september 2005 with these very words do not fear the real desirethe best contribution to the understanding of modern turkey i can make at this stage is through a theme i developed at that istanbul conference the relation between every living being and its area of existence is contained within it and in the case of human beings embodied in its very name the animate is present together with its area of living existence inside and not outside this being if you take this animate away from its area even on a golden plate it means that it is being cut at its very root deportation is something like that people who lived on this territory for 3 000 years people who produced culture and civilisation on this territory were torn from the land they had lived on and those who survived were dispersed all over the world if this axe to the root dominates the psychological condition of generations of this people you cannot simply act as if the rupture does not exist the experience is already internalised recorded on its people s memory its genetic code what is its name the discipline of law can be preoccupied with this question but whatever it decides we know exactly what we have lived through it can be understood even if i should not use the word genocide as being a tearing up of the roots there is nothing to do at this point but this should be understood very well i would like to illustrate this internalising of experience with a personal anecdote from several years ago an old turkish man called me from a village in the region of sivas and said son we searched everywhere until we found you there is an old woman here i guess she is from your people she has passed away can you find any relative of her or we will bury her with a muslim service he gave me her name she was a 70 year old woman called beatrice who had been visiting on holiday from france okay uncle i will search i said i looked around and within ten minutes i had found a close relative we knew each other because we are so few i went to the family s store and asked do you know this person the middle aged woman there turned to me and said she is my mother her mother she told me lives in france and comes to turkey three or four times a year but after a very short time in istanbul prefers to go directly to the village she left many years earlier i told her daughter the sad news and she immediately travelled to the village the next day she phoned me from there she had found her mother but she suddenly began to cry i begged her not to cry and asked her whether or not she will bring her body back for burial brother she said i want to bring her but there is an uncle here saying something and gave the phone to him while crying i got angry with the man why are you making her cry i said son he said i didn t say anything i only said daughter it is your mother your blood but if you ask me let her stay here let her be buried here the water has found its crack i became thrown away at that moment i lost and found myself in this saying produced by anatolian people indeed the water had found its crack a lady at the istanbul conference implied that remembering the dead meant coveting territory yes it is true that armenians long for this soil but let me repeat what i wrote soon after this experience at the time the then president of turkey suleyman demirel used to say we will not give even three pebblestones to armenians i told the story of this woman and said we armenians do desire this territory because our root is here but don t worry we desire not to take this territory away but to come and be buried under it very bad http www opendemocracy net home index jspthe website of agos is replaced with a black page with his photo and its editorial staff stated there are no words to express our pain 6 thousands of people marched in istanbul from the agos newspaper s office to the taksim square in a spontaneous protest of the assassination according to the

shameful act 32 prime minister recep tayyip erdo an the dark hands that killed him will be found and punished 37 32 armenian patriarch of turkey mesrob mutafyan declared 15 days of mourning for the armenian community in turkeythe irony of historylet s first repeat the news the opening date of the surp ha armenian church of ahtamar island in van which was restored last year but remained unopened has been postponed for the third time in a written statement from the governor of van it was announced that ahtamar church the restoration of which is complete will be opened to tourism on april 11 it was also said that the opening ceremony which will be attended by international guests will be organized by the governor of van and the ministry of tourism ten years ago i addressed public officials in van with my piece the ahtamar workers battalion and said instead of creating monsters to attract tourists note the historical sights in front of your eyes why does one need such mistaken steps van is a heaven of historical heritage why don t we sit down and think about how to restore this region armenians will come they say so what let them come and see the places of their ancestors what s wrong with that and i added if you need help we are ready to help o history o future the youth in turkey armenia and the diaspora are volunteers the ahtamar workers battalion is ready for your orders know this come let s not restore the ahtamar church merely as a building let s also restore our frayed souls at last after 10 years the restoration of ahtamar is finally done we would love to see turkey and armenia cooperate in this restoration but unfortunately it wasn t the case anyhow one needs to mention and give thanks for the meticulous work of the project manager cahit zeydan who tried to bring experts from armenia for consultation and was able to add the turkish armenian architect zakarya mildano lu to the project they did their best and a great job however the bureaucrats and the politicians messed it up they weren t able to realize the opening of the church first they postponed the opening which was announced as nov 4 2006 to april 2007 because of weather conditions then atilla ko the tourism minister announced that the ceremony will take place on april 24 then came the reactions to ko s timing armenian patriarch mutafyan declared no armenian including himself would join the ceremony if it was held on april 24 last week the subject was discussed in parliament chp zmir deputy erdal karademir asked whether holding the opening ceremony on april 24 the anniversary of the armenian genocide was the result of a specific akp policy the nationalist press on the other hand carried the opening of the church into its headlines as the treasonous opening in van and now the date is announced as april 11 it could only be possible to put a right job on a wrong course so successfully the impossible to hide hidden motive could not be more revealing a real comedy a real tragedy the government hasn t still been able to formulate a correct approach to the armenian question its real aim is not to solve the problem but to gain points like a wrestler in a contest how and when it will make the right move and defeat its opponent that s the only concern this is not earnestness the state calls on armenian historians to discuss history but does not shy from trying its own intellectuals who have an unorthodox rhetoric on the armenian genocide it restores an armenian church in the southeast but only thinks how can i use this for political gains in the world how can i sell it the shifting of the opening of the ahtamar church to april 24 is a clear indication of this dishonest thinking and now pay attention while the rejection coming from the nationalist camp and even from the armenian patriarch to the date of the opening creates a chance to correct the mistake an irony of history appears on the scene the irony says since you have shown irresponsibility let me add to it and reveals that the newly chosen date april 11 is indeed april 24 the april 11 of the year 1915 is exactly the april 24 of today due to the difference between the old and new calendars no wonder the date april 24 is a later addition to the armenian literature with the coming of the new turkish calendar that date on which the armenian intellectuals and leaders were sent to oblivion was indeed april 11 1915 now a question remains will those who have found april 24 problematic and have opted for april 11 instead choose to change the timing again or one could ask it this way are you sure is this your final decision http www turkishdailynews com tr article php enewsid 64438afptwo turkish policemen were wednesday acquitted over a scandal in which security forces posed for pictures with the suspected killer of turkish armenian journalist hrant dink the anatolia news agency said the court verdict will be a disappointment for dink s family who say police protected the self confessed killer ogun samast when he was seized in the northern city of samsun a day after dink was shot dead in istanbul last year footage and photos leaked to the media at the time showed officers some in uniform posing with samast aged 17 at the time as he held a turkish flag triggering accusations that some officials secretly approved of the murder eight police officiers were given disciplinary sanctions at the time but only metin balta the deputy head of the terrorism department and ibrahim firat a police chief in the same office were brought to court at the end of a trial which lasted a little over a year the court in samsun ruled that balta was not guilty of abusing his office by allowing acts unbefitting state officials and leading to the impression that there was sympathy for samast s action the report said the court also acquitted firat on the ground that there was no solid and convincing evidence to convict him of violating the secrecy of the investigation by leaking the images to the media it added dink 52 hated by turkish nationalists for calling the world war i massacres of armenians a genocide was gunned down on january 19 2007 outside the offices of his agos newspaper in central istanbul samast and 18 accomplices went on trial in istanbul last year the charge sheet says police received intelligence as early as 2006 of a plot organised in the northern city of trabzon samast s hometown to kill dink two soldiers members of the trabzon gendarmerie intelligence department were put on trial in january on charges of covering up intelligence about the murder plot they testified in court in march that they had passed on to their superiors information of a plot to kill dink but said no action was taken they also accused their superiors of fabricating documents after the murder to create the impression they had no prior knowledge of the plot the trial is seen as a test of ankara s resolve to eliminate the deep state a term used to describe security forces acting outside the law to preserve what they consider turkey s best interests al monitor sept 20 2013by yavuz baydar for al monitor turkey pulse posted on september 20 2013 it was an assassination that left an extraordinary mark on the turkish judiciary justice and public conscience so did the tragedy it symbolized with the case of hrant dink returned to ground zero six years after the murder the victim s family lost its patience in an open letter hrant dink editor of the weekly agos the voice of turkey s armenian community was gunned down on jan 19 2007 in a busy istanbul street by a young man named ogun samast the murder reverberated beyond turkey s borders in a matter of hours dink was the 62nd journalist to be killed in turkey since a libertarian constitution was introduced in 1908 yet because of his armenian background and much admired courage along with the reform process turkey was undergoing his murder trial which opened in july 2007 became the most significant litmus test for turkish justice exasperated by a spate of murky political murders in the 1980s and 1990s and encouraged by government statements the turkish public saw in the trial a threshold of hope the dink family hoped that the judicial process would uncover the assailant s links to shady deep state mechanisms a terrorist organization structure that they believed was behind the murder in the months leading up to the assassination dink stood trial three times for insulting turkishness under the infamous article 301 of the penal code and was convicted in two of the cases he was summoned to the istanbul governor s office where members of the intelligence service mit cautioned him over agos stories shortly before his murder far right types were spotted around the agos office and the newspaper was flooded with threats to shut up the case of his murder gradually transformed into a tussle between the judges and the dink family s legal team as evidence was presented and rejected and the process dragged on many of the requests by the dink lawyers were either turned down or lost in the labyrinth of red tape after six years the case wrapped up with 18 convictions for ordinary murder the supreme court of appeals has now deepened the family s tragedy overturning the lower court s rulings and ordering a review of the case it rejected the argument that a state harbored terrorist organization was behind dink s murder holding that the suspects should be retried on charges of belonging to an ordinary criminal organization that is a mafia style enterprise in a dramatic move dink s devastated wife and children released an open letter to the turkish public and international audience  as the dink family we will no longer be a tool in the game of state structures that insults us and will not attend the hearings of the review of the murder case the letter stated it further read since the slaying of hrant dink on january 19 2007 the system in turkey with its judiciary security forces military and civilian bureaucracy and political institutions has all but mocked us while pretending to pursue justice the criminal alliance called the state re committed the murder day by day hearing by hearing over and over again this alliance is the very crime syndicate that planned the murder and then covered it up no effective investigation was conducted at any stage of this case the biggest insult however came from the court when it ruled that no organization was involved in the murder the dink s letter leveled harsh criticism at the government of the justice and development party akp in this case political will was the only thing necessary to uncover the state s murder mechanisms and the criminal alliance despite all its public statements and pledges the government persistently refrained from displaying political will far from pursuing the case as a matter of honor the government chose to use the murder perpetrated during its own rule as a trump card to prosecute offenders only when the gun was pointed at itself it boasted no murder has remained unresolved during our term ignoring the slaying of the only armenian in republican history who had waged a vocal struggle for human rights we are no longer part of this show we have no expectation from anything in which the state is either in front of or behind the curtain last week one of the dink family s attorneys fethiye cetin published utanc duyuyorum i feel ashamed a book recounting how the case proceeded she argues that it is extremely unlikely that justice will prevail unless public pressure cranks up cetin complains of apathy on the part of the powerful istanbul bar association because of dink s armenian heritage she also argues that the prosecutor zekeriya oz known for investigating coup networks such as ergenekon was hampered by the deep state and that collusion between the state and the elected government was instrumental in covering up the murder the book provides a detailed accounting of these arguments an analysis published sept 19 by radikal which has closely followed the case contained a startling assessment all public servants suspected of involvement or negligence in the murder have been promoted former istanbul governor muammer guler became interior minister while former istanbul police chief celalettin cerrah was appointed governor of osmaniye the then trabzon police chief ramazan akyurek and engin dinc succeeded each other in ascending to the helm of the police s intelligence department avni usta who had filed the criminal complaint against dink under article 301 became the police chief of sirnak nihat omeroglu and muhittin mihcak who were instrumental in the appeals court s decision to uphold dink s conviction under article 301 were elected public ombudsman and deputy public ombudsman respectively the head of the appeals court hasan gerceker ascended to the arbitration board and hasan erbil to the chief prosecutor s office the implicated policemen never appeared before court and the investigation into public servants continues under the veil of secrecy dink devoted his life to trying to improve the conditions of turkey s 70 000 strong armenian minority the normalization of ties between turkey and armenia ankara s recognition of the great armenian tragedy in 1915 and rapprochement between turkey and the armenian diaspora with the seventh anniversary of his murder approaching there is no visible progress in any of these areas similarly there is no mention of armenians in ongoing speculation about the prospective democratization package whose official announcement has been postponed until late september the only positive development so far has been the return of about one fourth of the properties the state had seized from non muslim minorities the armenians are divided over akp rule some complain about the slow pace of reform while others refrain from criticizing the government on the grounds that they are better off compared to in the past on the political front turkish armenian normalization remains on the shelf the issue has moved down on
