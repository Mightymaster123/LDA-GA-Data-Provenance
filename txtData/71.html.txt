way interisland fare  the interisland airfare wars have just lost any semblance of sanity said scott hamilton an aviation consultant based in washington state it is completely ridiculous aloha s giveaway will draw attention away from go on the day of its inaugural flight  do we have a business motive for it certainly said john votsis aloha airlines vice president of sales we want the exposure because it s good for us to get good word about our airline in the public s awareness at anytime but especially when competitive pressures are on aloha decided there was no reason to stop at 19  you

social security which doesn t allow us much in the way of luxury said wise a retired inventory control manager so a free ticket really sounds good  i think with go coming in that perhaps we ll have cheaper airfares all around if the fares are lower than they have been i think maybe we ll travel more often  all kinds of buzz giving away seats generates much more free publicity than if aloha just matched the 19 fare hamilton said  you re going to see crowds of thousands you re going to see all the tv media you ll have all the radio media it s going to generate all kinds of buzz hamilton said you ll get all kinds of silly comments from consumers oh this is the greatest thing since sliced bread so i suppose that they figure that the free publicity will be worth more than 1 000 free seats but in the long run will it actually gain them any new business i think the answer is probably not hawaiian airlines declined to comment on aloha s giveaway jonathan ornstein chairman and ceo of go s parent company mesa air group inc said his company would have matched aloha s offer but doesn t have the available seats because of the customer response to the 19 fare  i imagine if you ve been trying to sell seats at 100 you d have seats left ornstein said given what they have charged in the past they probably owe a lot of their passengers free tickets the 19 dealshawaiian and go offered
