In First Veto, Bush Blocks Stem Cell Bill - The New York Times
advertisementby david stoutjuly 19 2006washington july 19 president bush vetoed a bill for the first time today using his constitutional power to reject legislation passed by congress that would expand federal research on embryonic stem cells a step he said would be crossing a moral line  this bill would support the taking of innocent human life mr bush said at the white house surrounded by scores of children born as a result of an embryo adoption program and their parents  each of these human embryos is a unique human life with inherent dignity and matchless value mr bush said looking at the children around him he said to loud applause these boys and girls are not spare parts the president said his own position on stem cell research articulated in 2001 already allowed research without sanctioning the practices that violate the dignity of human life advertisementfive years ago mr bush said he would allow federal research money to be used only on a limited number of stem cell colonies or lines those that were already in existence before aug 9 2001 he said his administration had made more than 90 million available for research on those lines advertisementthe legislation that mr bush vetoed today would have lifted that specific restriction greatly increasing the number of lines that would be available to scientists the senate approved the bill on tuesday with 63 yes votes 4 short of the two thirds majority needed to override a veto the house of representatives passed the legislation by 238 to 194 last year well short of a veto proof two thirds margin so barring sudden and dramatic shifts the legislation appears dead for the time being because embryonic stem cells have the potential to turn into almost any type of cell in the body scientists hope they can eventually be used to create tissue and repair the damage caused by various diseases but the process of creating stem cells now involves destroying the embryos a practice that mr bush and many others have denounced as immoral some conservative republicans who side with the president in firmly opposing abortion senators bill frist of tennessee the majority leader and orrin g hatch of utah for example have broken with him on the stem cell legislation since the bill approved by the senate on tuesday and earlier by the house would apply to excess embryos harvested for in vitro fertilization that would be destroyed in any case if not used in research critics of the legislation have said it still involves taking something that is living and making it dead for the purpose of research as the white house spokesman tony snow put it on tuesday like abortion stem cell research has stirred emotional debate in congress mr bush s comments today and those by lawmakers disappointed by the veto made it clear that the debate will remain highly charged in campaigns this fall as well as in congress and the disagreements among republicans showed the increasingly complex contours of the debate the white house ceremony was accompanied by happy children and their smiling parents but one element was missing a flourish of the pen that mr bush typically uses to sign a measure that he likes the president had already signed his name on the veto before appearing in public the actual signing was not photographed because mr snow said beforehand mr bush did not think it would be appropriate democratic lawmakers denounced the veto in advance at a capitol news conference  less than 24 hours after the senate passed groundbreaking stem cell legislation president bush is set to defy the will of the american people and crush the hopes of millions who suffer from debilitating conditions and diseases like diabetes spinal cord injury lou gehrig s parkinson s and others said senator harry reid of nevada the senate minority leader advertisement we are not going to give up this fight for stem cell research mr reid said we re going to press republicans to override a veto just as we pressed republicans to bring it to the senate floor and just as we pressed republicans to get it passed we didn t give up then we re not going to give up now mr reid said that most of the 44 democratic senators had sent a letter to senator bill frist of tennessee the majority leader and one of the 19 republicans who voted for the stem cell bill on tuesday we re so hopeful that he ll join us in this fight mr reid said senator edward m kennedy of massachusetts also sounded a note of defiance we will not give in he said we are going to continue this battle and we have every intention of success in winning this battle for families in our country and for people all over the world senator richard j durbin of illinois the senate minority whip said the strategy of the republicans who oppose the stem cell bill was clear it is their belief that if the president vetoes this bill quickly and does it early that people across america will forget by november and senator hatch the utah republican who usually sides with the white house also expressed disappointment telling the associated press that the veto sets back embryonic stem cell research another year or so that the president would use the first veto of his tenure on the stem cell bill was confounding said senator charles e schumer democrat of new york senator robert menendez democrat of new jersey said it was dismaying that mr bush heralds bipartisanship and then snuffs it out in his first opportunity representative nancy pelosi of california the house minority leader said that the veto amounted to saying no to hope it is up to members of congress she said to represent their constituents and vote to override the veto we re interested in your feedback on this page tell us what you think go to home page
