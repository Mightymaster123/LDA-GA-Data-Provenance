eight mcd run schools in jahangirpuri the survey notes though there are plenty of mcd schools in delhi providing free education to the children there are many problems being faced by these schools it

used for clerical work and most are unwilling to work in schools in slums there is shortage of non teaching staff also the survey says there are some schools in jahangirpuri that do not have a permanent peon this leads to a problem of theft and security in these schools the low salary of sweepers is a reason for their unwillingness to work in these schools the survey indicates  as the boundary walls are low outsiders enter the schools even during school hours they use the buildings as venue for gambling smoking or drinking the classrooms are not safe either because of poor construction work the survey points out problems of improper sanitation dirty toilets unavailability of drinking water and electricity absence of a parents teacher association pta and sports equipment
