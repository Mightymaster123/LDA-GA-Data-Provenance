another step in its transformation from a search engine into an advertising powerhouse doubleclick which is based in new york city specializes in software for display advertising and has close relationships with web publishers advertisers and advertising agencies  it s the two juggernauts in search and display getting together said martin reidy president of modem media an ad agency in the publicis groupe for computer users the deal could mean more advertising tailored to their online habits especially if doubleclick and google combine some of their huge databases of information on internet use to direct specific ads to different web surfers tastes advertisement this merger is really a part of a global growth strategy for google eric e schmidt google s chief executive said in a conference call advertisementmr schmidt said that being able to kick start google s display advertising business and marry it with search advertising was the most compelling reason for the purchase the sale of doubleclick involved weeks of negotiation that included at one point yahoo aol and most prominently microsoft which has been trying to position itself as an advertising rival to google even though microsoft has more cash on hand than google the company was ultimately outbid  keeping microsoft away from doubleclick is worth billions to google an analyst with rbc capital markets jordan rohan said yet again microsoft is on the sidelines and away from the action the acquisition will also strengthen google s position with respect to yahoo its chief rival in internet search and advertising and a leader in the sale of display ads doubleclick may not be a household name but it is the most prominent ad serving company on the web meaning that it delivers display ads from ad agencies to the sites where they are run doubleclick provides software and services to both web publishers like myspace and aol and to advertisers and agencies who buy the ads doubleclick s software culls data about web surfers interaction with ads to determine how to place the most effective display ads google for all its outsize reputation has made most of its money in the online basics the text based search engine and small text ads that are like the yellow pages of the online advertising doubleclick s strength by contrast lies in flashy banner ads and more recently video ads that are more like high end magazine or television ads google has taken steps in the last year to enter display advertising by expanding its adsense program but has not gained great traction advertisement google really wants to get into the display advertising business in a big way and they don t have the relationships they need to make it happen said dave morgan the chairman of tacoda an online

people are reading about the two companies will work together to deliver what google called more relevant ads in a news release  you can dive deep into that data and say who were those people where do they live what were they doing when they looked at those ads said randall rothenberg the chief executive of the interactive advertising bureau a group in new york that represents online publishers including google you can protect privacy and provide great insights for advertisers the sale raises questions about how google will manage its existing business and that of the new doubleclick unit while avoiding conflicts of interest if doubleclick s existing clients start to feel that google is using doubleclick s relationships to further its own ad network some web publishers or advertisers might jump ship most of doubleclick s clients are locked into long term contracts to keep using doubleclick and doubleclick s chief executive david rosenblatt said in an interview last night that the company would protect its ability to remain neutral with its clients  we are exquisitely sensitive to our role as switzerland mr rosenblatt said in the simplest sense they bought customer relationships and they re primarily focused on making sure not only are those relationships preserved but that they are enhanced and made better mr rosenblatt said that google s vast network of advertisers would offer doubleclick publishers more opportunities to monetize their sites a highflying stock in the late 1990s doubleclick was an early pioneer in online advertising and was one of the few online ad companies to survive the burst of the dot com bubble in 2005 it was taken private by two private equity firms hellman friedman and jmi equity in a deal valued at 1 1 billion since then the company has sold two data and e mail advertising businesses and acquired klipmart which specializes in online video doubleclick generated about 300 million in revenue and 50 million in earnings before interest depreciation and taxes last year mostly from providing ads on web sites advertisementwhile some suggested that 3 1 billion was a high price for doubleclick others said google was buying far more than doubleclick s cash flow and google has plenty of cash to spare at the end of last year it had 11 24 billion in cash and marketable securities people close to the deal said it came down to a matter of price google outbid microsoft in an echo of a bout in december 2005 when the two rivals bid for the right to sell ads on time warner s aol unit google won then too agreeing to pay 1 billion for a 5 percent stake in aol one attraction for google was doubleclick s new exchange that brings web publishers and advertising buyers together on a web site where they can participate in auctions for ad space  what this represents is the further acceleration of google creating the spine of being able to manage information on consumer entertainment said richard beaven chief executive
