other potentially illegal behaviour and at the relationships between the press and the police and the press and politicians what did lord justice leveson recommend he made broad and complex recommendations relating to how the press is regulated why did he recommend reworking press regulation the current system where the press is self regulated voluntarily through the press complaints commission pcc is widely agreed to be doomed the pcc itself has agreed to move into a transitional phase until a long term replacement can be established the chairman of the pcc lord hunt wants a new tough independent regulator with teeth he told the leveson inquiry there was a willingness among publications for a fresh start and a new body based on legally enforceable contracts between publishers and the new body the free speech network which represents many editors and publishers is vigorously opposed to any state involvement in press regulation it says the press exists to scrutinise those in positions of power and it could not do that if those it was scrutinising had authority over it but the hacked off campaign which represents many alleged victims of phone hacking says voluntary self regulation has failed and its said that the leveson proposals are the way forward will his recommendations be implemented prime minister david cameron had reportedly promised to implement the recommendations providing they were not bonkers but within hours of the report s publication he said that he was not convinced legislation underpinning self regulation was right mr cameron then warned the press the the clock is ticking for them to introduce a self regulation system with the tough powers set out by lord justice leveson  that means million pound fines proper investigation of complaints prominent apologies he said deputy prime minister nick clegg says he backs leveson highlighting a split within the coalition government labour leader ed miliband has urged the government to accept the report in its entirety what about broadcasters and the internet the inquiry has been specifically into the press not into the media more generally broadcasters are regulated by ofcom which is backed by law other people publishing on the internet such as bloggers and tweeters are not regulated as such but are covered by laws on issues such as libel and contempt of court some including mps and peers have questioned the wisdom of bringing more regulation to the press and not the wider internet lord justice leveson himself referred to material on the internet as the elephant in the room however any publisher could sign up to the new legislation backed self regulator that lord justice leveson envisages how was the inquiry conducted witnesses during eight months of hearings
