tharunka admin january 31 2014 frontpage news online comments 1 480 views30th january 2014 the new south wales parliament passed sweeping legislative changes today including controversial mandatory minimum sentences and cbd lock outs in response to so called alcohol fuelled violence in related news democracy in nsw sculled half a beer before proceeding to pass out in a pool of its own vomit the legislation the liquor amendment bill and crimes and other legislation amendment assault and intoxication bill were first seen by parliamentarians at 10 a m thursday morning the ink still drying from what could only have been an all nighter in parliamentary council the laws bring with them an eight year non parole period for the new offence of an assault causing death under the influence of drugs or alcohol as well as placing new conditions on over 900 venues in the sydney cbd area and restricting the sale of alcohol from bottle shops until 10 p m across new south wales while the latter is unlikely to affect preloading purchases from the bottle shops owned by the big supermarket chains the provision will also extend to small specialty businesses tharunka spoke to nathan besser co owner of popular delivery service jimmy brings who said licensing legislation doesn t adequately define our unique operation we have been caught in the crossfire and will be forced to close at 10pm this will see their distribution hours cut by 30 and a 50 loss in revenue they have already written to the premier to seek an exemption other controversial measures include increased penalties for offensive behaviour and language which the deputy opposition leader linda burney said would most negatively affect young and indigenous people as well as people suffering from mental illness or disadvantage she said this while supporting the aforementioned changes notably there is now an 1100 fine for disobeying a move on order and a 500 fine for swearing in public fuck that shit while the greens put forward a few hail mary amendments in the last minutes of the debate to try to remove these increased penalties for summary offences they were rejected by both the government and labor the process wizardry was not limited to the greens with lake macquarie mp greg piper ind attempting a classic manoeuvre which would replace all the words of the legislation with a clause for a parliamentary committee to review it instead this too was sadly yet predictably rejected all these changes occurred in less time than it takes me to book a domestic holiday this is not so surprising given that a i get a bit lost on expedia and b the opposition announced they would be supporting the legislation even before they had seen it while labor were quick to take credit for the adoption of the newcastle solution of lock outs and last drinks within the legislative package as a part of their drink smart home safe policy members of the public and press gallery could only watch on in a queasy mix of horror and giggles as every single labor member used their time to find a new way to condemn mandatory minimum sentences before agreeing to vote for them  the opposition believes that mandatory sentencing will have both unintended and adverse consequences the honourable adam searle mlc there is considerable evidence that mandatory sentencing is counterproductive and does not work mandatory sentencing has been tried before in new south wales and failed it was such an abject disaster that it was hurriedly repealed mr paul lynch mp no right thinking person believes that mandatory sentencing is an appropriate response particularly under these circumstances because it produces injustice mr ron hoening mpeven if they supported every sentence of the liquor amendment bill and felt politically wedged by the mandatory minimums package they didn t put forward a single amendment or support any amendments though it is normal to end up compromising on issues and voting for things you don t agree with completely what happened today was not compromise this was a rubber stamp it s not all labor s fault though even the attorney general greg smith is on record calling mandatory minimum sentences an expensive and ineffective crime fighting tool he added a corollary however saying that if community expectations did not match the sentences handed out by the judiciary we must have an informed debate about the issue and he s right we do need an informed debate about the issue but we didn t get one instead we were given a parliament dragged back from their summer break we had legislation written by the daily telegraph and changes to normal parliamentary procedure which the shadow minister for health and liquor regulation dr andrew macdonald criticised saying debate has been effectively gagged the government was still making changes to the bills after they d been introduced protesters showed up not fully knowing what it was that they were protesting when the mps for sydney and balmain alex greenwich ind and jamie parker grn questioned the possibility of displacement of violent people from the cbd to other areas the premier accused them of running a scare campaign the premier mocked greg piper s surprise at the scope of the bill of course he was surprised he had only just read it because the premier had only just finished writing it this is a complex issue that deserved a real debate as the premier stated the relationship between alcohol and violence is a problem that has existed here since the first fleet arrived 226 years ago and celebrated their arrival with a drunken bacchanalia on the shores of circular quay in referencing cities like new york and copenhagen greens mlc dr mehreen faruqi said we have evidence from across the world that the provision of convenient and frequent late night transport is a key factor in preventing violence and injury labor s penny sharpe insightfully commented on alcohol advertising around the city for example a giant bottle of vodka with the words arrive boldly if that is not an ad for preloading i do not know what is opposition leader john robertson thought businesses could be encouraged to be a larger part of the solution with risk based licensing providing hotels and bottle shops with a financial incentive to operate safe premises rather than comprehensively addressing any of these issues we had an intentionally rushed debate on legislation poorly considered the phrase unintended consequences worked its way in to chambers eleven times as in i m pretty sure these laws are going to have unintended consequences like locking up disproportionate amounts of young and indigenous people but it s not like we can change the law right in an environment where we often lament at how long it takes governments to make changes already agreed upon by the public it is shocking that nsw criminal law could undergo such a fundamental shift with such velocity there is infrastructure in place for issues in crisis or flux that need a prompt response but it is odd to think that a problem which has existed since the first fleet was going to be resolved in an afternoon as alex greenwich put it we need the right solution not the right now solution government is slow at times painfully such but this slowness is necessary it is a reflection of health in an active democracy where everyone has a say and everyone theoretically has an informed vote legislation is supposed to be built on consultation mps are supposed to take it to their electorates the legislative council is supposed to engage with experts and interest groups democracies are more or less stable places precisely because we engage in protracted debates until 11 at night between these groups rather than having dramatic overhauls in our laws overnight and yet today legislators passed rushed laws in the same time as you allocate to your rushed gen ed essay today should make you angry not swear on the street angry though because it ll cost you 500 if you vote liberal you should be angry because they betrayed their core principles without asking you you re now the anti business big spending party if you vote labor you should be angry because the party that backs the working class is apparently the party without a spine if you vote green or independent you should be angry your representatives worked their arses off and they still couldn t stop the big guys from taking a panic induced dump on your democracy and if you vote shooters or cdp you re probably bonkers or racist or both you ll fit right in with the paper that s
