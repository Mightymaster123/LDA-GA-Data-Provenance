Obama endorses McConnell payroll tax cut plan
president obama today endorsed a proposed compromise by the senate republican leader on the payroll tax cut impasse to have house republicans pass a temporary two month extension while senate democrats agree to negotiate a year long extension at the same time  we should go ahead and get this done obama said at the white house this should not be hard in pitching his compromise senate minority leader mitch mcconnell r ky said the republican run house should approve a two month extension now while the democratic run senate should agree to immediate negotiations on a year long extension as requested by the house we can and should do both mcconnell said in a statement senate majority harry reid d nev said democrats seconded mcconnell s idea once the house passes the senate s bipartisan compromise to hold middle class families harmless while we work out our differences i will be happy to restart the negotiating process to forge a year long extension house speaker john boehner meanwhile continued to push for a one year extension now tweeting we re here calling on the president and senator reid to work with us to fix this mistake and extend payroll tax relief for a full year boehner spokesman brendan buck said it s disappointing the president says he agrees with the house s desire for a full year extension but has still declined to negotiate with republicans to make it a reality in his remarks at the white house obama said he expects the new mcconnell plan to happen sooner or later so that americans can avoid payroll tax hikes on jan 1  why not make it sooner rather than later obama said the white house also announced that obama told boehner in a phone call this morning that he is prepared to work immediately on such a year long plan once the house signs off on the senate s temporary bill in its readout of the obama phone call boehner s office said the speaker asked obama to have members of the white house economic team help negotiate a one year extension boehner s office said obama declined  the speaker explained his concern that flaws in the senate passed bill will be unworkable for many small business job creators said the readout from boehner s office he reiterated that if their shared goal is a one year bill there is no reason an agreement cannot be reached before year s end the parties are talking just nine days before the end of the year when a payroll tax cut approved in 2010 would expire and taxes rise for about 160 million americans it s mcconnell s first public comment since the republican run house rejected a senate compromise plan crafted in part by mcconnell that called for extending the payroll tax cut now for two months then have lawmakers negotiate a year long extension after the holiday recess boehner and other republicans say they want to work out a one year extension now obama and some republicans said that at this point the senate s two month plan is the best way to ensure that americans taxes do not rise when the payroll tax cut expires at the end of the year in his call for a compromise mcconnell pointed out that the senate bill as well as an earlier house plan contain other items including an extension of unemployment insurance the plans also include provisions designed to pressure obama into approving the keystone xl oil pipeline from canada to texas obama says the proposed pipeline requires further environmental study mcconnell s full statement  the house and senate have both passed bipartisan bills to require the president to quickly make a decision on whether to support thousands of u s manufacturing jobs through the keystone xl pipeline and to extend unemployment insurance the temporary payroll tax cut and seniors access to medical care there is no reason why congress and the president cannot accomplish all of these things before the end of the year house republicans sensibly want greater certainty about the duration of these provisions while senate democrats want more time to negotiate the terms these goals are not mutually exclusive we can and should do both working americans have suffered enough from the president s failed economic policies and shouldn t face the uncertainty of a new year s day tax hike leader reid should appoint conferees on the long term bill and the house should pass an extension that locks in the thousands of keystone xl pipeline jobs prevents any disruption in the payroll tax holiday or other expiring provisions and allows congress to work on a solution for the longer extensions here s boehner s readout of the phone call with obama  today speaker boehner called president obama to discuss the speaker s desire to provide a full year of tax relief for american families before december 31st with senator harry reid having declined to call his members back to washington this week to join the house in negotiating a full year extension of the payroll tax cut the speaker proposed that the president send members of his economic policy team up to congress to find a way to accommodate the president s full year request the speaker explained his concern that flaws in the senate passed bill will be unworkable for many small business job creators he reiterated that if their shared goal is a one year bill there is no reason an agreement cannot be reached before year s end the president declined the speaker s offer and here s the white house readout  speaker boehner called the president this morning and the president reiterated to the speaker that the only viable option currently on the table is for the house of representatives to pass the bipartisan senate compromise that received the support of nearly 90 percent of the senate the president told speaker boehner that he is committed to begin working immediately on a full year agreement once the house passes the bipartisan senate compromise that prevents a tax hike on 160 million americans on january 1 david s journalism career spans
