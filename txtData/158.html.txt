small traders were on the agenda  on the one hand the bjp says it is working in the interest of the people of delhi and on the other it obstructs the working of the house just when the three path breaking resolutions meant to provide relief for common people were introduced in the house mr goyal said mr kochar said the resolution for deferring demolition action on unauthorised properties as well as on sealing of commercial units were brought in the house after prior consultations with chief minister ms sheila dikshit  an 18 member delegation which included congress leaders like rambabu sharma and sajjan kumar met the chief minister last week and conveyed to her the sense of urgency among the mcd to provide relief to the small traders and commoners by passing the two resolutions in the house at the earliest to enable their passage in the assembly before the expiry of the deadline set by the courts mr kochar said  in fact the resolutions are being sent to the delhi government

prerogative whether or not to accept the tabling of a resolution in the house road widening projects hang fire in gurgaon abhay jaingurgaon march 13 it is quite difficult for the authorities to widen or strengthen the roads here the reason they are lined with trees and permission to uproot them involves the forest departments of the state and union governments this has forced huda and pwd b r to postpone the deadlines of various projects the chief minister mr bhupinder singh hooda had inaugurated the project to widen many roads from four lanes to eight lanes from rajiv chowk to badshahpur drain costing around rs 7 5 crore on february 23 however the work had to be suspended midway as the forest department did not give permission to cut the trees on both sides of the road the work of

26a road sikanderpur faridabad road has also been suspended the deadlines for these projects were december 31 2005 or january 31 2006 all these roads are in a state of disrepair concrete stones are scattered across the roads making it quite hard for the commuters to use them as a result the roads witness jams throughout the day however the administrator haryana urban development authority huda mr s p gupta claimed that the widening process was being expedited the local forest department had earmarked 588 trees from mahavir chowk to badshahpur drain and fixed a compensation of rs 2 crore for these trees we would soon complete the procedure as soon as the forest department gets the permission to uproot them mr gupta said there are 77 trees on railway road 42 trees on road from bhuteshwar mandir to sector 9 and 79 trees on the road from pataudi chowk to sector 10 added mr gupta the department is ready to pay rs 35 lakh rs 49 lakh and rs 33 lakh as compensation to the forest department  we would complete the project on priority basis as soon as we get the roads cleared of the trees claimed mr gupta the deputy commissioner mr r p bhardwaj elaborated that the space left on both sides of the road was called strip protected forest and no one has the power to cut the trees planted on these areas as per the direction of the supreme court each tree has to be compensated by the department concerned and the permission has to be taken from the state and union forest departments before cutting any single tree added the dc for cutting down the 588 trees from mahavir chowk to badshapur drainage around 7 km stretch the forest department has to plant saplings on 85 km stretch to maintain the ecological balance explained mr bhardwaj as far as the delay in widening of roads is concerned the dc asserted that the administration would expedite the matter and fulfill all formalities to complete the project shortly ncw calls for report on murder of women lawyers tribune news

of lpg prices in capital tribune news servicenew delhi march 13 domestic lpg prices will not come down in the national capital despite the delhi government reducing vat rates on cooking gas from 12 5

be used to partly cover the losses the reduction was not being passed on to the consumers he said petroleum ministry officials said the delhi government s announcement was of no consequence after the
