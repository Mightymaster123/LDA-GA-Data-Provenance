Many Goals Remain Unmet in 5 Nationsâ€™ Climate Deal - The New York Times
advertisementby john m broderdec 18 2009copenhagen president obama announced here on friday night that five major nations including the united states had together forged a climate deal he called it an unprecedented breakthrough but acknowledged that it still fell short of what was required to combat global warming the agreement addresses many of the issues that leaders came here to settle but it has left many of the participants in the climate talks unhappy from the europeans who now have the only binding carbon control regime in the world to the delegates from the poorest nations who objected to being left out of the critical negotiations by the early hours of saturday representatives of the 193 countries who have negotiated here for nearly two weeks had not yet approved the deal and there were signs they might not but mr obama who left before the conference considered the accord because of a major storm descending on washington noted that the agreement was merely a political statement and not a legally binding treaty and might not need ratification by the entire conference the three page accord that mr obama negotiated with the leaders of china india brazil and south africa and then presented to the conference did not meet even the modest expectations that leaders set for this meeting notably by failing to set a 2010 goal for reaching a binding international treaty to seal the provisions of the accord advertisementnor does the plan firmly commit the industrialized nations or the developing nations to firm targets for midterm or long term greenhouse gas emissions reductions the accord is nonetheless significant in that it codifies the commitments of individual nations to act on their own to tackle global warming advertisement for the first time in history mr obama said all major economies have come together to accept their responsibility to take action to confront the threat of climate change the accord provides a system for monitoring and reporting progress toward those national pollution reduction goals a compromise on an issue over which china bargained hard it calls for hundreds of billions of dollars to flow from wealthy nations to those countries most vulnerable to a changing climate and it sets a goal of limiting the global temperature rise to 2 degrees celsius above preindustrial levels by 2050 implying deep cuts in climate altering emissions over the next four decades but it was an equivocal agreement that was to many a disappointing conclusion to a two year process that had the goal of producing a comprehensive and enforceable action plan for addressing dangerous changes to the global climate the messy compromise mirrored the chaotic nature of the conference which virtually all participants said had been badly organized and run in a news conference mr obama said the accord was only a tentative start down a long road  this progress did not come easily he said and we know that this progress alone is not enough the accord sets no goal for concluding a binding international treaty which leaves the implementation of its provisions uncertain it is likely to undergo many months perhaps years of additional negotiations before it emerges in any internationally enforceable form mr obama said before he left copenhagen that he was confident that a final accord would be reached here he looked weary and his eyes were bloodshot as he left the conference center for his motorcade to the airport some environmental groups gave a cautious nod of approval to the agreement as a good start  the world s nations have come together and concluded a historic if incomplete agreement to begin tackling global warming said carl pope executive director of the sierra club tonight s announcement is but a first step and much work remains to be done in the days and months ahead in order to seal a final international climate deal that is fair binding and ambitious it is imperative that negotiations resume as soon as possible advertisementsenator john kerry democrat of massachusetts chairman of the foreign relations committee and lead author of the senate s climate change bill said the accord would drive the congress to pass climate change legislation early next year  this can be a catalyzing moment he said president obama s hands on engagement broke through the bickering and sets the stage for a final deal and for senate passage this spring of major legislation at home but there were serious rumblings of discontent that could yet scuttle the deal lumumba stanislaus di aping a sudanese diplomat who has been representing the group of 77 developing countries denounced the accord please verify you re not a robot by clicking the box invalid email address please re enter you must select a newsletter

result in massive devastation to africa and small island states he and many other representatives of the most vulnerable countries wanted a target of 1 5 degrees  today s events which really are a continuation of the history of the negotiations for the last two years represent the worst development in climate change negotiations in history mr di aping said mr obama s announcement came late in a day that began with his 11 minute address to world leaders shortly after noon and that was filled with brinksmanship and 11th hour negotiations mr obama whose speech included remarks that appeared pointed at china s resistance to mechanisms for monitoring emissions reductions met privately with prime minister wen jiabao afterward but mr wen did not attend two smaller impromptu meetings during the day that mr obama and united states officials conducted with the leaders of other world powers an apparent snub that infuriated administration officials and their european counterparts the deal eventually came together after a dramatic moment in which mr obama and secretary of state hillary rodham clinton burst into a meeting of the chinese indian and brazilian leaders according to senior administration officials mr obama said he did not want them negotiating in secret the intrusion led to new talks that cemented central terms of the deal american officials said sergio serra brazil s senior climate negotiator here confirmed that mr obama had joined a meeting of brazilian indian chinese and other officials although he did not say that mr obama walked in uninvited  after several discussions had taken place they were joined by president barack obama mr serra said several important decisions were taken not a few due to brazilian mediation that we hope will bring a result if not what we expected that may be a way of salvaging something and pave the way to another meeting or series of meetings to get the full result of this proceeding advertisementjian xiaoyan a press officer with the chinese government said there was no one available to comment friday night the agreement apparently grew out of a document that was being edited by high ranking officials from some two dozen countries throughout the day but many specifics that were included in earlier versions were excised in the document left on the table when mr obama made his announcement and many parties considered it at best a work in progress the agreement contains several enumerated points asserting a general commitment to the idea that climate change is one of the greatest challenges of our time and asserts that deep cuts in global emissions were required in at least one earlier version the deal included a collective agreement among nations to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 50 percent by 2050 with developed nations pledging as a bloc to reduce emissions by 80 percent over the same period those numbers were no longer in the version circulated after mr obama s announcement also dropped from earlier drafts was language calling for a binding accord as soon as possible and no later than at the next meeting of the parties in mexico city next november the deal presented friday evening said only that the agreement should be reviewed and put in place by 2015 the document does lay out a framework for verification of emissions commitments by developing countries and for establishing a high level panel to assess financial contributions by rich nations to help poor countries adapt to climate change and limit their emissions many of the specifics remained to be negotiated however mr serra the brazilian diplomat said that the process left many alienated particularly the smaller countries that have little influence in a major international negotiation many involved in the process here suggested this would be the last time that 193 nations would gather in this way to negotiate such a complex accord  certain groups like g 77 are not happy when a few people make decisions mr serra said it s not an inclusive exercise perhaps it can t be an article on dec 19 about the announcement of a climate deal signed by the united states china india brazil and south africa at talks in
