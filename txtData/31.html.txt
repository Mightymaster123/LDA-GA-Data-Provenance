Current political events, business, real estate, financial and economic news, trends and, above all, the Future. — Garth Turner – Commentaries
january 7th 2010 the economythis site contains the thoughts and bloggings of a canadian who was elected to parliament twice who decided he would represent constituents first and political masters second and paid the price for such heresy they are maintained as a record as such they speak for themselves to hear what garth turner is saying now try this comments off on this just in august 8th 2009 canadian politicsbook review by john baglowsheeple caucus confidential in stephen harper s ottawa garth turner key porter 224 pages softcover isbn 9781554701797i like the quixotic former conservative member of parliament garth turner his quirky adherence to principle and his exuberant maverickism i used to check out his blog fairly regularly and i looked forward to reading his expos of the conservative caucus the sheeple of the title of his new book but i will admit that i expected more of sheeple caucus confidential in stephen harper s ottawa than it delivered turner does not entirely disappoint digital democracy versus the iron heel is a great theme the mildly eccentric man of principle a journalist with a taste for blogging versus the tightly wound intensely ideological and media hating stephen harper the book is not well constructed however there is far too much cutting forward and backward in time in a contrived and at times confusing attempt to build suspense and maintain narrative tension but the story line is actually rather simple turner elected in 2006 with lukewarm support from his own party made the big boys furious when he came to ottawa and within the year he was given the heave harper and his advisors we learn control the conservative caucus to the last detail and squelch dissent most have already drawn that conclusion i think but to hear it from an insider certainly reinforces it the other strand of narrative is the notion of blogging as a kind of direct and open democracy a new way of doing politics for me that is where the interest of the book really lies although turner raises more questions than he answers it must be said that there is something self serving and disingenuous about the air of puzzled innocence that turner affects as he recounts his political tale of woe he is no neophyte he was a progressive conservative mp under brian mulroney ran for the pc leadership and was even minister of national revenue for a short spell under the ill fated kim campbell given his experience he would have been well aware that his enfant terrible antics would worry and anger his colleagues yet he feigns surprise that they caused quite predictable consequences and his principles which appear entirely genuine fetched up against the shoals of a realpolitik with which we must assume he was intimately familiar his story in any case very nearly tells itself to turner s considerable credit he chose to stick to those principles in opposition his party had belittled and insulted belinda stronach for crossing the floor to the liberals and taking up a cabinet post but immediately after the 2006 election david emerson who had just been elected as a liberal did precisely the same joining the conservative cabinet on february 6 even before the new parliament had sat turner was outraged but the conservative top guns in effect gave him pitying smiles snaffling the capable emerson was a coup and that was that then turner told the media what he thought about it and that initiated a downhill slide that would end a mere ten months later with his ouster from caucus so badly had he offended the powers that be in fact that he was forbidden to run as a conservative ever again as turner tells it an mp s job has evolved into representing a party to the people not the people to parliament conservative mps were expected to be docile meekly accepting talking points from the prime minister s office and obediently parroting them caucus debate was unwelcome people were shouted down when they attempted it guy lauzon now chair of the conservative caucus told him we have no room for an independent thinker on our team and we had an election and we have a platform and that s what we think from the point of view of any political party in power turner would come across as dangerously unpredictable a classic loose cannon that was not the way turner thought though which might not have mattered so much had he not had an increasingly popular blog to which he contributed a thousand independent words a day on it he insulted fellow caucus members suggesting that they were being bought off with posts and perks he called some of them hats and horses colleagues worse he publicly questioned and even opposed the government s electoral platform and policy yet he pretends to be shocked by the consternation that this inevitably caused things quickly began to escalate an attempt was made to steal his nomination for the next election with the help of the sinuous televangelist charles mcvety it failed which turner attributes to his blog finally charged with breaking caucus confidentiality he was expelled from the point of view of any political party in power no matter what the issues or the ideologies turner would come across as dangerously unpredictable a classic loose cannon he may or may not have broken caucus confidentiality he sort of admits that he did on one occasion but says he removed the offending words in his blog as soon as he was asked to but he certainly had a lot of powerful people on edge an odd mixture of narcissism self righteousness and boyishness pervades his account he calls himself an unusual renaissance man when he refers to himself as a digital trojan horse it is impossible to tell whether he is being ironic or simply boasting it may be a bit of both my crime was information he says but my potential for mayhem was much worse the virus of empowerment might spread but what does he mean by empowerment and who exactly is empowered turner revelled in the internet s sheer anarchy he was obsessed hooked addicted high on the narcotic of digital populism he goes on leaders and parties fear the potential of the internet for the massive destabilization it could bring the digital world is like an out of control town hall meeting blogging is as insanely dangerous as it is gloriously democratic all great fun of course but government is serious business how is control restored how is a new stability maintained how does anything get done in the future that he imagines in fact there is far less to blogging than meets his overly enthusiastic eye and the only federal politician destabilized by it so far has been turner himself the blog reading demographic is hardly representative of the real world electorate which refused to return him to ottawa as a liberal in 2008 according to a harris poll last year most adults do not read political blogs those who do tend to be in their mid forties or older and only a few of them leave comments not that the new communications technology should be underestimated in early april in the tiny eastern european republic of moldova thousands of demonstrators stormed the country s parliament to protest a communist electoral victory forcing a recount six people explained organizer natalia morar ten minutes for creativity and action a few hours of information on networks facebook blogs sms texting to friends and an e mail newsletter all of the organization through the internet on the street came out 15 000 young people but turner exaggerates the importance of blogging to the point that he claims it is better than going door to door and actually meeting people face to face which is what won him his election in the first place blogging is less intrusive he says but blogs are also bloodless remote and easily ignored and blog readers as noted are not the general public but an unrepresentative slice of it blogging also creates the illusion of public dialogue when a controversial public figure posts lots of comments are guaranteed in response but turner s out of control town hall meeting in his case between 1 5 million and 2 million visitors a month is hardly a conversation to many people i suspect the political blogosphere resembles an auditorium full of lunatics talking to themselves and shouting at each other as they pass hurriedly by a new way of doing politics a new tool certainly with much potential but as turner unwittingly demonstrates we should not let ourselves get carried away comments off on a digital trojan horsejuly 17th 2009 canadian politicsdear garth i just finished after the crash it is a great read the fact that it could use some editing only underlines the urgency of the global situation thanks for the hard work my household along with lots of others i am sure is putting some of your sage advice into practice thankfully we are in good shape already but we are preparing for a long hard time you are likely challenged even confronted at times illegitimati non carborundum don t let the bastards drag you down just continue to do good and to show concern we are not responsible for the actions and sentiments of others we can only strive to do what is right ourselves you needn t respond as i am sure that you are busy i just wanted to thank you cheers john harveymr turner i purchased and the next day finished your book sheeple as someone who tried political activism at the time of the merger between the ca and pc parties i discovered though not nearly to the detailed extent that you did how political parties in general and the cpc in particular truly operate your book was more depressing than alarming confirming what i feared i already knew about partisan politics in canada lamentations aside thank you for trying to be a principled politician and for subsequently writing your book i only hope it opens a few more eyes to the sad state of democracy in our country also as a former resident of wellington halton hills and someone who voted for michael chong when he first ran i was both heartened and saddened to read your account of his despicable ouster from the cpc i am glad the faith i once placed in him to be an mp of strong principle was not unfounded and if you still keep in touch with mr chong i would ask that you tell him i for what it s worth applaud his actions when told to act against his better judgment indeed his very moral code thank you again anonhi garth thank you for writing sheeple i just now finished reading the book bought it after hearing you on the sunday edition in conversation with michael enright and elizabeth day democracy is my passion but i am looking at it from the other end of the spectrum the municipal level i have written a book about it citizens hall making local democracy work and i hold to the belief that if citizens cannot assume the responsibility of democracy at the local level how in hell can they ever be expected to deal effectively with the political machinery installed in provincial capitals and in ottawa i knew it was bad up there but i had no idea just how bad it was until i read sheeple depressing but not without a glimmer of hope thanks for writing it andreandre
