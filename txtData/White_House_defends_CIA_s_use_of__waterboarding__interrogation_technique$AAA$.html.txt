White House defends CIA's use of 'waterboarding' interrogation technique - Wikinews, the free news source
thursday february 7 2008 the white house is defending the use of the interrogation technique known as waterboarding in certain rare circumstances when suspects are believed to have knowledge of an imminent threat the central intelligence agency now admits it used the technique roughly five years ago on three top terror suspects white house spokesman tony fratto says president bush personally authorized the disclosure breaking with the long standing practice in the administration of refusing comment on specific interrogation techniques he says the decision to have central intelligence agency chief michael hayden go before a congressional committee and reveal the use of waterboarding in the past was difficult because it could provide the enemy with information about the cia s program for questioning terror suspects  this decision to allow general hayden to talk about the technique wasn t taken lightly fratto said there was discussion of great concern about starting to talk about something we don t ordinarily do for reasons that we feel very strongly about fratto says so much misinformation has been disseminated about the interrogation program that the white house felt it was time to set the record straight fratto says waterboarding which simulates drowning was approved in a few specific instances and with certain safeguards in place the cia banned the practice in 2006 fratto says interrogators might be able to use it again but emphasized they would need authorization from the president to do so he noted that any cia request to use the technique would have to be declared legal by the justice department before consideration at the white house he says approval depends on the circumstances adding one important factor would be the belief that an attack might be imminent  any change to the enhanced interrogation technique that may be used will follow the process that i outlined which includes a legal review and notification of congress he said critics have called waterboarding a form of torture but fratto says its use in the past under the conditions approved by the attorney general and the president was legal on capitol hill a senior democrat senator dick durbin of illinois denounced the use of waterboarding under any circumstances he noted that in its annual human rights report the u s state department is quick to condemn other nations that use harsh interrogation techniques on prisoners  so once a year we stand in judgment of the world and condemn them for engaging in waterboarding and torture techniques on their prisoners he said and yet it is clear from the testimony yesterday of general hayden that we have engaged in some of those own techniques the u n s torture investigator also responded to the cia disclosure calling on the bush administration to give up its defense of enhanced interrogation methods such as waterboarding manfred nowak told the associated press in geneva that these techniques are totally unacceptable under international law have an opinion on this story share it share this this page is archived and is no longer publicly editable got a correction add the template editprotected to the talk page along with your corrections and it will be brought to the attention of the administrators please note that due to our archival policy we will not alter or update the content of articles that are archived but will only accept requests to make grammatical and formatting corrections note that some listed sources or external links may no longer be available online due to age got a correction add the template editprotected to the talk page along with your corrections and it will be brought to the attention of the administrators please note that due to our archival policy we will not alter or update the content of articles that are archived but will only accept requests to make grammatical and formatting corrections
