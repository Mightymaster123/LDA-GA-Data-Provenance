accessibility linkstuesday 29 march 2016by robert tait jerusalem4 44pm gmt 11 feb 2014an outline middle east peace agreement being drawn up by john kerry will propose recognising israel as a jewish state according to a leaked report in a development that represents a major coup for the israeli leadership but which risks an outright palestinian rejection mr kerry the us secretary of state has overridden vocal palestinian objections in stipulating that israel s jewish character should be an explicit part of a final status accord the conservative israeli newspaper maariv reported he is expected to present a copy of the so called framework agreement to benjamin netanyahu when the israeli prime minister visits washington early next month to meet president barack obama and address the annual conference of aipac america s most influential pro israel lobby group european diplomats are said to have warned that the palestinians will perceive the document as biased in israel s favour and are unlikely to accept it the document which has been several weeks in the making will term israel as the nation state of the jewish people according to maariv citing a us source under mr kerry s peace plan it would exist alongside palestine which would be the nation state of the palestinian people in another concession to israel the document will propose a peace deal along pre 1967 borders but with land swaps that take account of demographic changes on the ground a phrase the palestinians dismiss as designed to enable the israelis to keep settlements in the occupied west bank and east jerusalem jordan valley settlers fear for future in their slice of heavenred cross suspends emergency tents to palestiniansisrael insists on jordan valley presence as kerry pushes peace planjohn kerry frustrated by palestinians refusal to recognise jewish israelmr kerry s acceptance of israel s demand to be recognised as a jewish state is a blow to mr abbas who argues that it would compromise the position of the country s 1 5 million arab citizens the palestinians say it would also mean surrendering on the demand of a right of return for five million refugees who include those who fled their homes at the time of israel s 1948 war of independence as well as their descendants  when you talk about a jewish state you are talking about the end of the end of any solution for palestinian refugees do you think any palestinian can accept this nabil shaath a senior palestinian official and former foreign minister told journalists in a recent briefing in ramallah if mr kerry thinks this is the sum of his brilliant intelligence the document will go nowhere it s impossible for the palestinians to sign such an agreement with israel palestinian officials point out that egypt and jordan signed peace deals with israel without directly recognising its jewishness mr netanyahu by contrast has called the issue the biggest single obstacle to an accord and has made it the central point in his talks with mr kerry the us secretary of state is trying to thrash out a framework agreement that would extend the current round of negotiations beyond their nine month time frame which expires on april 29 the document is expected to fudge intractable issues such as the status of jerusalem and security arrangement for the jordan valley a strategically sensitive area border area of the west bank where israel insists it should maintain an indefinite military presence the palestinians want east jerusalem a sector that includes the biblical city s holy sites as their capital but mr netanyahu is demanding that a palestinian capital be sited in an unspecified area termed greater jerusalem possibly meaning the city s outer lying suburbs he also wants reference to the palestinian demand to be referred to as merely an aspiration in comments illustrating the chasm dividing the two sides nabil abu rdeineh mr abbas spokesman warned that the framework document should not cross palestinian red lines reuters reported that would mean clearly recognising the 1967 borders as the frontier dividing the two states designating east jerusalem as the palestinian capital and calling israel s settlements on occupied land illegal he said mr kerry has said the settlements are illegitimate in israeltop news galleriesin pics inside the city of pripyat abandonded in 1986these are the world s
