world around them in 2014 he worked with a friend to write anonymously from inside the prison where he was being held in his inaugural post on the blog me in syrian jail he asserted that he had been arrested for his writing for his ideas despite the danger and difficulty his writing has a sense of triumph because the government wanted to shut me up because it failed and this blog is the proof his tweets from the same offline blogging project reminded us that we can t fight jail without memory and imagination like bassel we believe in the power of writing words and memory every day hundreds of millions of people visit free knowledge projects like wikipedia to learn remember and create we gain from the generosity of wikimedia contributors around the world but very few of us pause to consider the challenges many of those contributors may face the news of bassel s death is a painful reminder of the risk and difficulty so many people confront in simply exercising their fundamental rights to share and learn we believe that everyone should be able to speak freely and share freely we believe that this commitment to expression openness and creativity is a reminder of our shared humanity and the foundation for a better world the global movement for open cultures and free knowledge is stronger because of bassel s contributions we mourn his loss and join his family friends and communities
