In Sentence of Activist, China Gives West a Chill - The New York Times
advertisementby andrew jacobsdec 25 2009beijing the harsh sentence handed down on friday to liu xiaobo one of china s most prominent campaigners for democracy and human rights prompted strong rebukes in the united states and europe but it also raised fresh questions over whether the west has much leverage over a government that is increasingly self assured on the world stage by sentencing mr liu to 11 years in prison for subversion the chinese government sent a chilling message to advocates of political reform and free speech mr liu 53 a former literature professor who helped draft a manifesto last december that demanded open elections and the rule of law was convicted after a closed two hour trial on wednesday in which his lawyers were allowed less than 20 minutes to state his case but many experts on chinese politics said that mr liu s conviction on vague charges of incitement to subvert state power through his writing was also an unmistakable signal to the west that china would not yield to international pressure when it came to human rights during his visit to china last month president obama raised mr liu s case with president hu jintao leaders of the european union have been pressing for his release but a spokesman for china s foreign ministry described such pressure on tuesday as gross interference in china s judicial internal affairs the next day more than two dozen american and european diplomats who sought to observe the trial were barred from the courthouse advertisement if china s communist party wanted to advertise to the world that they will do anything to protect their power and use the judiciary to accomplish that then the persecution of liu xiaobo was a perfect vehicle jerome a cohen an expert on china s legal system and a senior fellow at the council on foreign relations said friday the state department issued a statement on friday calling on china to release mr liu saying that the persecution of individuals for the peaceful expression of political views is inconsistent with internationally recognized norms of human rights advertisementchancellor angela merkel of germany said she was dismayed by the sentence the united nations said mr liu s conviction had thrown an ominous shadow over china s commitments to human rights such pointed criticisms are unlikely to have much impact many china analysts said mr hu assumed full power in 2003 after a period of modest legal reforms but under his leadership the government has presided over a tightening of internet restrictions the repression of rights lawyers and the persecution of intellectuals who called for greater transparency and an end to single party rule those who thought that the leadership might loosen its controls for the beijing olympics last year were disheartened by the crackdown that took place to prevent people from organizing demonstrations edward friedman an expert on chinese politics at the university of wisconsin in madison said many people in the west had been clinging to the misguided notion that china s economic development would quickly lead to political liberalization it s clear that what matters most to the chinese communist party is the survival of the regime and their monopoly on power he said many human rights advocates partly blame western political leaders for putting up with china s growing intolerance of domestic dissent they contend that as china s economic power has expanded the united states and europe have been softening calls for human rights they were especially critical of secretary of state hillary rodham clinton s visit to beijing last february arguing that human rights took a back seat to an agenda focused on economic concerns and efforts to gain china s cooperation in dealing with iran and north korea many human rights advocates were also unhappy with mr obama s decision to put off a meeting with the dalai lama the tibetan spiritual leader shortly before the president s visit to beijing the move they said was intended to avoid offending china advertisementthe white house insists that it is committed to promoting freedom but says that it is trying to make its case without the public hectoring favored by the bush and clinton administrations mrs clinton has called the approach principled pragmatism phelim kine a researcher with human rights watch in hong kong said that quiet diplomacy was valuable at times but that without real pressure from the united states its largest trading partner china had no incentive to improve its human rights record in the aftermath of the tragic conviction of liu xiaobo we really need to think about how the u s is going to engage china and make sure that there are real benchmarks for progress he said he and others maintain that the united states and its allies must break free from a mentality that fears the economic might of a rising china the united states can no longer prod china on human rights through the annual battle over most favored nation trading status because china is now a member of the world trade organization but human rights advocates say that the white house still has substantial leverage when it comes to trade and while china may hold hundreds of billions of dollars of the united states government s debt in the form of treasury bonds and other treasury securities some analysts play down concerns about the possibility of china retaliating against american pressure over human rights by selling off its holdings gordon chang the author of the coming collapse of china said that the chinese government simply had nowhere else to park its swelling foreign reserves china s huge trade imbalance with the united states mr chang said is a potential cudgel that washington should be prepared to use president obama can get on the phone with hu jintao and say these are the things you need to do he said  we are extremely indulgent about irresponsible chinese conduct when it comes to human rights mr

such efforts must be coordinated with other countries that have significant trade with china otherwise he said the chinese government can simply play one nation against the other even if you have unity on the issue you re not guaranteed to win but without it you don t stand a chance he said when it comes to facing pressure from the west or agitation by activists at home chinese leaders do not want to appear weak but in the end they will place domestic concerns first and it is at this audience that crackdown on dissent is aimed as use of the internet has spread and uneven economic growth creates ever larger gaps between rich and poor the government is nervous about the potential for unrest that could threaten its power while they were not timid in their prosecution of mr liu the authorities made sure that coverage of his trial stayed out of the state run news media even as it questioned hundreds of people who signed charter 08 the manifesto mr liu helped to draft government censors had any mention of the document quickly scrubbed from the internet after it became public a year ago there was one exception however on friday the english language edition of xinhua the official news agency published a brief item about mr liu s sentencing the article said the court had strictly followed the legal procedures in this case and fully protected liu s litigation rights the chinese language version of xinhua however made no mention of the verdict instead it declared 2009 the year of citizens rights jonathan ansfield contributed reporting a version of this article appears
