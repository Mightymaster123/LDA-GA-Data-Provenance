with the boy now accusing him of child molestation and he defended as loving his practice of letting young boys sleep in his bed in november of 2003 california authorities searched jackson s neverland ranch following molestation allegations against the singer jackson was booked on child molestation charges that month and released on 3 million bail formal charges against jackson were filed in december 2003 a grand jury indicted the 46 year old pop star in april 2004 on charges of molesting the boy at the center of the trial giving him alcohol and conspiring to hold him and his family captive in 2003 jackson pleaded not guilty to the charges and did not testify during the trial testimony and closing arguments stretched nearly 14 weeks before the jury got the case prosecutors alleged that following the broadcast of the bashir documentary in 2003 jackson and five associates plotted to control and intimidate the accuser s family to get them to go along with damage control efforts including holding them against their will at neverland the molestation charges relate to alleged incidents between jackson and the accuser after the bashir documentary aired jackson s lawyers however consistently portrayed the singer as a naive victim of the accuser s family who they claimed were grifters schemers with a habit of wheedling money out of the rich and famous the jackson trial was full of salacious testimony dramatic moments and celebrity defense witnesses key moments among the more than 130 people who testified were former child star macaulay culkin he disputed testimony from earlier witnesses who claimed they saw jackson behaving inappropriately with him in the early 1990s on march 10 the first day jackson s accuser testified the pop star arrived late for court as

gingerly with a bodyguard and his father supporting him the accuser now 15 testified in graphic detail about what he claims were molestations by jackson on two separate occasions in early 2003 during cross examination however the teenager admitted he told an administrator at his school that nothing happened between him and the singer prosecution witnesses included the accuser s mother who was on the stand for three days and a former security guard who testified that he saw jackson engaged in oral sex with another teenage boy that boy received an out of court settlement in his family s molestation case against the pop star for an undisclosed amount jackson was not charged in that case and denied any wrongdoing testimony in the trial closed with prosecutors showing a police videotape
