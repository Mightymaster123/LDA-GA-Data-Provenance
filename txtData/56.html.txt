at the statehouse before the start of the scheduled second reading for the proposed constitutional amendment prohibiting same sex marriage on thursday february 13 2014 two amendments have been filed to restore the ban on civil unions photo charlie nye the star buy photoin the end neither opponents nor supporters were totally satisfied monday when the debate over indiana s same sex marriage ban came to a close at least for the rest of this legislative session after an hourlong debate the senate voted 32 17 in favor of the weakened constitutional ban which had encountered many ups and downs over six weeks some conservatives who had fought for the constitutional ban for years weren t all that happy with its passage because it didn t include original language that also would have banned civil unions the house removed that provision last month database how indiana senators voted on hjr 3after a weekend twitter tirade that in part blamed inactive churches for the weakened ban sen mike delph announced at a news conference that he was voting against it because it was too watered down  for my faith and plain spokenness i make no apologies delph said opponents were pleased it didn t include the broader ban but still saw the measure known as house joint resolution 3 as a form of discrimination against gays and lesbians more coverage errika d smith tepid vote on hjr 3 proves times are changing we have the opportunity to make history today by puttting an end to hjr 3 once and for all democratic leader tim lanane of anderson urged the senate time is not on the side of discrimination despite monday s favorable vote the measure will not go on the november ballot as supporters such as gov mike pence had hoped two separately elected legislatures must approve constitutional amendments with identical language before they can go to voters and the amendment approved this year now differs from the one passed in 2011 because it does not include the ban on civil unions consequently the general assembly would have to approve the revised ban again in 2015 or 2016 before a public referendum could be held in november 2016 senate president pro tempore david long said he expects the general assembly to take up the ban again next year  that is our intent right now he said i ll have to sit down with all of our caucus and decide that but i think right now that s our mindset lobbying groups supporting the constitutional ban expressed mixed feelings about the outcome  we applaud this symbolic statement affirming the truth that marriage is not just any relationship but the special union of a man and a woman said micah clark executive director of the american family association of indiana but he said it is disappointing the legislature decided to leave the future of marriage in the hands of judges and activists for another two years clark said the ideal of marriage deserved to be protected and passed on to the next generation hoosiers should have been allowed the right to vote on this rather than risk another two years of having a new definition of marriage forced upon every church school and business in indiana a sigh of relief megan robertson campaign director of freedom indiana a group formed to fight the amendment said we can finally breathe a collective sign of relief that lawmakers are finished with the amendment this session and it will not appear on the ballot this november she characterized opponents as underdogs in this fight from the beginning and said everyone involved should be proud of their hard work  our success reflects the strength of the incredible coalition we were able to build in just six months she said quickly shifting public opinion away from such bans and recent court opinions against them make it unclear how well a constitutional ban on gay marriage would be received a year from now three years ago only 10 senators all democrats voted against the amendment while more from each party voted against it this year the amendment was eight votes short of being defeated still monday s vote revealed a shift among lawmakers in the senate six members who voted for the amendment in 2011 including delph voted against it this time others who changed their votes were sen ron alting r lafayette sen vaneta becker r evansville sen phil boots r crawfordsville sen frank mrvan d hammond and sen tim skinner d terre haute all the supporters were republicans with the exception of sen richard young d milltown becker said she switched her vote because of strong opposition among constituents universities and the business community in the evansville area i heard back from over 1 000 constituents and 800 were opposed to hjr 3 she said while she added she supports traditional marriage becker said since we already have a law on the books we really don t need to deal with this issue current state law bans gay marriage but some conservatives also want the ban to be enshrined in the state constitution so it would be more difficult to undo alting who previously had announced his opposition said he changed his mind because the constitution should grant people rights not take them away he said the amendment sends a terrible message to the rest of the country about indiana not being very tolerant the perception is that it s just mean no arm twistingduring this whole process alting said there was no arm twisting or baseball bat approach by leadership in the old days there might have been a threat you vote this way with leadership or i ll pull your chairmanship there was none of that none of that with the issue decided for this session it s now going to be up to another legislature to consider whether to pass it again  it s passed the house and senate four times now said brandt hershman r buck creek so i think historic evidence is it can pass the general assembly and i think the polls suggest that even though public opinion has changed somewhat a clear majority of people want the opportunity to vote on the issue either pro or con call star reporter tony cook at 317 444 6081 follow him on twitter indystartony newsexclusive special prosecutor investigating allegations
