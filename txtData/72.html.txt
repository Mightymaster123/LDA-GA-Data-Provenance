jetliners that go will put into interisland service starting tomorrow each plane can accommodate 50 passengers gregory yamamoto the honolulu advertiserinterisland air passengers began benefiting from an old fashioned fare war yesterday when the islands newest airline go announced temporary one way ticket prices of 19 in time for the busy summer travel season just three summers ago interisland rates were running at or above 200 for roundtrip tickets even before its maiden flight tomorrow go s arrival in the hawai i market has forced its larger competitors aloha and hawaiian airlines to match some of go s reduced fares hawaiian immediately matched the 19 fare with the same restrictions as go and aloha left the door open to do the same while 19 fares will not last long one way tickets to neighbor islands likely will stay below 70 and possibly less than 60 for as long as jet fuel prices remain stable and aloha hawaiian and go battle for passengers according to industry executives  i think it s definitely permanent said jonathan ornstein chairman and ceo of go s parent company mesa air group inc when asked about the low fares i think our high fare will be lower than the lowest fare in the past he said referring to the 80 to 90 one way fares of a year ago that prediction was echoed by scott hamilton an aviation consultant based in washington state who said no airline can be profitable selling interisland tickets for 19 or even 39 which go previously offered and was matched by hawaiian and aloha  he ornstein can t be profitable at 39 hamilton said i think he ll do 59 and 69 fares hawaiian and aloha will match passengers coming in and out of honolulu international airport s commuter terminal yesterday said the cheaper ticket prices can t come soon enough  why couldn t we get them today asked lydia zabala of laredo texas who just stepped off a flight from maui becs vierra of lahaina maui spent 630 for five roundtrip tickets to fly her family from maui to honolulu yesterday  i hope the prices go down absolutely she said with five of us it s not easy we definitely go for the lowest rate  thousands of ticketsornstein said at a press conference yesterday that go would offer thousands of one way 19 fares between noon yesterday and midnight tomorrow or until the tickets are sold out the 19 seats were available for travel between honolulu and lihu e kaua i kahului maui or kona hawai i from tomorrow through july 9 and between honolulu and hilo hawai i from june 30 through july 9 go officials did not specify how many 19 tickets are available and said 19 seats may not be available on all flights tickets will be nonrefundable and no changes will be allowed fares can be booked online at www iflygo com or by calling toll free 888 iflygo2 ornstein said he has heard from island residents who said high ticket prices for years have prevented them from traveling between islands with 19 one way ticket prices he said we ll help bring family and friends together no one has any excuses not to visit their mother in law aloha which earlier met go s announced 39 fares had yet to match the 19 ticket prices as of yesterday afternoon  it doesn t mean we will or we won t said aloha spokesman stu glauberman tomorrow s another day four 50 seat jetlinersgo will rely on a fleet of four 50 seat canadair crj 200 jets hamilton the aviation consultant called the small jets a miserable airplane the crj 200 offers small seats with not much padding hamilton said but for interisland flights of 30 or 40 minutes who cares go s entry into the interisland market hamilton said puts the most pressure on aloha which emerged from federal bankruptcy protection in february with limited cash reserves  put aloha on your titanic watcher hamilton said when you get into a fare war cash is king it s going to be a battle of attrition between the three airlines and aloha is playing the weakest hand thom nulty aloha s senior vice president of marketing and sales said in a statement yesterday over the years we ve seen many startups come and go with goofy fares designed to steal passengers away from hawai i s homegrown airlines while aloha will always be competitive we will also act responsibly to ensure that hawai i s people have the high quality reliable full size jet service they expect from us mark dunkerley president and ceo of hawai i s largest airline hawaiian said in a statement we know that people will shop and compare and we re confident they ll appreciate hawaiian s high quality of service proven track record of reliability and our commitment to the community we re ready to compete starting out with 8 go will command only about 8 percent of the interisland market when it begins service tomorrow hamilton said but ornstein is betting on increasing go s market share through cut rate ticket prices hamilton said  with a 50 seat airplane he can t make up on volume at some point ornstein will try to put in bigger aircraft than the 50 seat planes possibly a 90 seat crj or the embry air 195 which holds about 100 passengers the maneuvering at the corporate level yesterday held no interest for lynn fragas who flew into honolulu international airport s commuter terminal yesterday from waimea on the big island even if one of hawai i s perennial airlines goes under from the added pressure fragas was happy with go s new presence in the market  competition s definitely good it s healthy fragas said competition stimulates everything reach dan nakaso at dnakaso honoluluadvertiser com and rick daysog at rdaysog honoluluadvertiser
