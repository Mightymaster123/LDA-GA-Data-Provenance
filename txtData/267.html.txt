british broadcasting corporationhomeaccessibility linksreligious leaders across the world have criticised switzerland s referendum vote to ban the building of minarets the vatican joined muslim figureheads from indonesia and egypt as well as switzerland in denouncing the vote as a blow to religious freedom france s fm bernard kouchner expressed shock at the ban which he said showed intolerance and should be reversed but european right wing groups welcomed the result calling for other countries to take similar measures more than 57 5 of swiss voters and 22 out of 26 cantons or provinces voted in favour of the ban on sunday the proposal had been put forward by the swiss people s party svp the largest party in parliament which said minarets were a sign of islamisation  expression of intolerance the vatican on monday endorsed a statement by the conference of swiss bishops criticising the vote for heightening the problems of cohabitation between religions and cultures egypt s grand mufti ali gomaa described the ban as an insult to the feelings of the muslim community in switzerland and elsewhere sunday s surprise result also prompted dismay from secular leaders in europe  i am a bit shocked by this decision mr kouchner told france s rtl radio on monday it is an expression of intolerance and i detest intolerance  i hope the swiss will reverse this decision quickly but marine le pen the deputy leader of france s far right national front praised the outcome and said france should now hold a wider referendum on multiculturalism  the elites should stop denying the hopes and fears of european peoples who without opposing religious freedom reject ostentatious symbols forced on them by politico religious muslim groups often verging on provocation she was quoted as saying by agence france presse in belgium italy and the netherlands anti immigrant movements called on their own governments to debate similar measures  what can be done in switzerland can be done here said geert wilders the head of the freedom party in the netherlands meanwhile roberto calderoli a member of italy s northern league which is part of the country s ruling coalition said switzerland is sending us a clear signal yes to bell towers no to minarets in recent years countries across europe have been debating how best to integrate muslim populations france focused on the headscarf while in germany there was controversy over plans to build one of europe s largest mosques government ignoredthe vote is very bad news for the swiss government which fears unrest among the muslim community says the bbc s imogen foulkes in bern the swiss government had opposed the ban saying it would harm switzerland s image particularly in the muslim world voters worried about rising immigration and with it the rise of islam had ignored the government s advice our correspondent adds the government said it accepted the decision and that the construction of new minarets would no longer be permitted justice minister eveline widmer schlumpf said concerns about islamic fundamentalism have to be taken seriously  however a ban on the construction of new minarets is not a feasible means of countering extremist tendencies she sought to reassure swiss muslims saying the decision was not a rejection of the muslim community religion or culture  major problems switzerland is home to some 400 000 muslims and has just four minarets after christianity islam is the most widespread religion in switzerland but it remains relatively hidden there are unofficial muslim prayer rooms and planning applications for new minarets are almost always refused supporters of a ban claimed that allowing minarets would represent the growth of an ideology and a legal system sharia law which are incompatible with swiss democracy but others say the referendum campaign incited hatred on thursday the geneva mosque was vandalised for the third time during the campaign according to local media amnesty international said the vote violated freedom of religion and would probably be overturned by the swiss supreme court or the european court of human rights the president of zurich s association of muslim organisations tamir hadjipolu told the bbc this will cause major problems because during this campaign mosques were attacked which we never experienced in 40 years in switzerland  islamaphobia has increased intensively sunday s referendum was held after the svp collected 100 000 signatures from voters within 18 months calling for a vote what are these print sponsormost popular
