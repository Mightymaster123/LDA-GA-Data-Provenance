What We’ve Learned About Boyajian’s Star I: Background | AstroWright
for those just catching up on tabby s star read kimberly cartier s article in scientific american and my series of blog posts here and don t read or trust anything the daily mail writes on this or any other topic involving me the star exhibits two unique and very difficult to understand behaviors the short term dips in brightness of up to 22 and long term brightness variations on years to centuries timescales since the kepler mission stopped observing it it seems to have continued it slow decline in brightness over the past few years and that dimming does not seem to be due to solid objects but we still don t have any information about what s responsible for the dips because we hadn t been able to see one happening in real time but now thanks to the generous support of our kickstarter backers tabby s team has been able to pay for year long monitoring of the star with the las cumbres observatory global telescope network to catch it in the act of dipping again so we can study what s going on and in may it finally happened when by amazing coincidence i just happened to be at the breakthrough listen lab at uc berkeley during my sabbatical since then tabby s team has been able to collect a huge amount of data not only from our own organized follow up efforts but thanks to he amazing generosity and interest of astronomers around the world who volunteered to observe the star during the dips we sincerely appreciate their contributions and they are all authors of our latest paper you can follow every twist and turn of this summer s activity on the kickstarter project blog here and follow along with the fans of the project on the reddit page here s what s been going on all summer and fall in this plot the different colors represent different lco sites where data were taken the brightness of the star is on the y axis and the date measured in days with an arbitrary offset astronomers like to use is on the x axis one of the rewards for our kickstarter backers was to name the various dips they need names after the first elsie a nod to las cumbres observatory lc who was one of our most generous backers the star continued to oblige with a series of dips the next dip celeste was named as a near reversal of elsie when it looked like the two events might be exhibiting time symmetry it s also a nod to team member angelle tanner s mother who sadly died around the time of the event the subsequent events have started a theme of lost cities which it seems the backers would like to maintain going forward after all of that the star exhibited a strange brightening for a couple of months to recap we were hoping that once we finally caught a dip happening in real time we could see if the dips were the same depth at all wavelengths if they were nearly the same this would suggest that the cause was something opaque like a disk or whispering alien megastructures the long term dimming doesn t seem to be the same at all wavelengths which suggests it s being caused by something like ordinary astronomical dust but that doesn t tell us what s causing the dips which are what got everyone excited in the first place so what have we found well our paper with a huge author list has been accepted by astrophysical journal letters thanks to a quick and conscientious referee and we re ready to reveal what happened in part ii   or it could be so cold that all of its gas has condensed onto grainshow would a super cold region in space effect the flux of a star like kic 8462852 what would cause a super cold region to exist in the vicinity of tabby s star as well is there an oort cloud such as the one theorized to be orbiting our solar system that could possibly reflect heat back into the solar system similar to a mylar blanket reflecting 90 of the body heat of the user back to keep the user warm could the dips in the light curve of kic 8462 be attributed to an oort cloud https space facts com wp content uploads oort cloud pnga good rule of thumb known by most britons is to treat everything written by the daily mail with suspicion hi jasoni have a thought about the brightening for us to see anything we have to be close to the ecliptic whatever made the huge 22 dip and other dips has to go to the far side from us of its orbit eventually whatever it is unless it is totally black is going to reflect some of the star s light given the brightening data this might put some constraints on what is in orbit around this strange acting star your email address will not be published required fields are marked commentname email notify me of followup comments via e mailastrowright gmail com525 davey laboratory department of astronomy astrophysics the pennsylvania state university university park pa 16802
