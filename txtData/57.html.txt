consider it unacceptable gay people are still living in fear said king oey chairman of the country s main gay rights group ap photo binsar bakkara while gay rights activists celebrate gains in much of the world their setbacks have been equally far flung and often sweeping in scope in russia a new law against gay propaganda has left gays and lesbians unsure of what public actions they can take without risking arrest in india gay rights supporters were stunned by a recent high court ruling re criminalizing gay sex a newly signed law in nigeria sets 10 year prison terms for joining or promoting any gay organization while a pending bill in uganda would impose life sentences for some types of gay sex in such countries repression of gays is depicted by political leaders as a defense of traditional values the measures often have broad support from religious leaders and the public limiting the impact of criticism from outsiders the upshot a world likely to be bitterly divided over gay rights for years to come globally the contrasts are striking sixteen countries have legalized same sex marriage nationwide including canada south africa argentina uruguay brazil and new zealand as well as 10 european nations and gay marriage is legal in parts of the united states and mexico yet at least 76 countries retain laws criminalizing gay sex including five where it s punishable by death here s a look at major regions where the gay rights movement remains embattled or marginalized ___africa according to human rights groups more than two thirds of african countries outlaw consensual same sex acts and discrimination and violence against gays lesbians and transgender people is commonplace while many of the laws date to the colonial era opposition to homosexuality has gained increasing traction as a political tactic over the past two decades in 1995 president robert mugabe of zimbabwe who s still in office denounced gays and lesbians as worse than pigs and dogs he has since been joined by political and religious leaders continent wide calling for punishments ranging from arrest to decapitation uganda s president yoweri museveni has said he opposes a bill passed by lawmakers that calls for life imprisonment for gays though he also characterized homosexuals as abnormal and said they should be rehabilitated africans promoting anti gay legislation have expressed alarm about gains made by sexual minorities in the united states and europe they say laws such as the one newly signed in nigeria can serve as a bulwark against western pressure to enshrine gay rights in liberia for example a religious group called the new citizen movement has spent the past year collecting signatures urging president ellen johnson sirleaf to sign a law banning same sex marriage even though as in nigeria there has been no local movement to legalize it rev cleopatra watson the group s executive director said nigeria s law was a prayer answered that could lead to the passage of similar legislation in other african countries from afar nigeria s new law has drawn harsh criticism from human rights groups western governments and u n secretary general ban ki moon however support for anti gay legislation presents few domestic political risks for african leaders with polls suggesting most citizens believe sexual minorities are not entitled to basic civil rights in cameroon gay men are routinely sentenced to prison for gay sex and in july a prominent gay activist eric ohena lembembe was tortured and killed in an attack gay rights supporters nonetheless hold out hope for long term change suggesting that recent anti gay rhetoric and laws were a response to an emergence of sustained gay rights activism  if there weren t an increasingly effective movement there would not be such a virulent backlash said neela ghoshal a researcher at human rights watch ___asia the world s largest continent asia is a mixed bag when it comes to gay issues due to vast differences in culture religion and history though no asian nation yet allows gay marriage thailand has a government sponsored campaign to attract gay tourists while china vietnam and taiwan among others are increasingly accepting of gays and lesbians however malaysia bangladesh and pakistan outlaw gay sex and for the moment so does india following the recent decision of its high court to revive a ban on gay sex that had been quashed by a lower court in 2009 the high court said it s up to lawmakers not judges to change the law amid the legal wrangling gays and lesbians have gained a degree of acceptance in parts of india especially in big cities where gay pride parades are now a fixture many bars have gay nights and some high profile bollywood films have dealt with gay issues in most of the country however being gay is seen as shameful and many gays remain closeted gautam bhan an indian gay activist said he was heartened by the vocal outcry against the high court ruling  there may be a backlash and reversals but the long term trend is toward openness freedom and diversity he said eventually we will get past this law in majority muslim malaysia the government has shown no interest in promoting gay rights sodomy is punishable by 20 years in prison and whipping with a rattan cane and censorship rules forbid the production and screening of films that might be considered supportive of gay rights earlier this month the home ministry declared a coalition of activist groups illegal partly because they were deemed to have championed gay rights  malaysia is at the worst end of the scale said grace poore a malaysian who is asia program coordinator for the international gay and lesbian human rights commission they are targeting lgbt people because they are convenient scapegoats in heavily muslim indonesia gay sex is not criminalized and many young urban indonesians are relatively tolerant of homosexuality but most citizens consider it unacceptable  gay people are still living

unsuccessfully for same sex marriage ___eastern europe russia s law banning gay propaganda has drawn extensive criticism abroad but seems to be widely accepted at home perhaps not surprising in a country where a popular news anchorman recently said homosexuals hearts should be buried or burned the law was signed in june by president vladimir putin after sailing through parliament it levies heavy fines on anyone convicted of propagandizing nontraditional sexual relations among minors putin in his third term has been catering to an increasingly conservative constituency repeating catch phrases about russia s traditional values and condemning the west for trends that threaten to destroy them including homosexuality that language has struck a chord in much of russia where the rising influence of the orthodox church and widespread ignorance about gays has contributed to acceptance of the propaganda law polls indicate that the vast majority of russians don t have a single gay acquaintance and oppose expansion of gay rights as a result a growing cadre of public figures shows no hesitation to demonize gays state television anchor dmitry kiselyov told audiences that homosexuals should be banned from donating blood or organs saying that they should be burned or buried instead kiselyov later was appointed by putin to head russia s largest news agency ivan okhlobystin a popular actor and former priest told his fans that he would gladly burn them gays alive calling them a real danger to my children gays face various problems in many other parts of eastern europe including the balkans a traditionally conservative region where anti gay violence has been on the rise assaults and harassment have coincided with the strengthening of right wing groups amid persistent economic problems conservative groups in croatia backed by the roman catholic church forced a referendum in december to define marriage as a union of a man and a woman only voters overwhelmingly supported the measure dealing a blow to the liberal government and triggering criticism from the european union which had just admitted croatia in serbia a gay pride march in 2010

coastal town of budva hundreds of police officers fought right wing extremists who sought to disrupt the gathering and participants were eventually evacuated in boats ___middle east across most of the middle east homosexual relations are taboo though not all nations choose to prosecute homosexuals and punishments vary the pervasiveness of religion in everyday life along with strict cultural norms plays a major factor in how middle eastern societies view homosexuality the common arabic word used to refer to gays is derogatory and its actual meaning translates as abnormal or queer same sex relations are punishable by death in the muslim majority nations of iran mauritania saudi arabia sudan and yemen in yemen more than 30 people suspected of being of gay were killed by unidentified assailants in the past two years many in southern provinces where al qaida is active iraq also has experienced a surge of killings of gays in egypt consensual same sex relations are not explicitly prohibited but other laws those prohibiting debauchery or shameless public acts have been used to imprison gay men public acceptance of gays in israel and lebanon is higher than the rest of the region according to a pew research center study released last year lebanon and israel promote gay tourism and publisher nabil mroueh says his company in beirut lebanon s capital has translated nearly a dozen english books about homosexuality into arabic among most palestinians homosexuality is generally disdained and gays tend to be secretive about their social lives in the west bank a 1951 jordanian law banning homosexual acts remains in effect as does a ban in gaza passed by british authorities in 1936 in israel by contrast gays serve openly in the military and in parliament and many popular artists and entertainers are gay assessing the region as a whole activists take heart from modest changes even it s simply the inclusion of gay rights in broader discussions about human rights in the middle east  the situation doesn t look good said hossein alizadeh a middle east specialist with the international gay and lesbian human rights commission but that doesn t mean we stop working ___associated
