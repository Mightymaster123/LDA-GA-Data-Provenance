by justin george and jorge sanchez published march 22 2005citrus county probation officials said monday that if they had known john evander couey was a registered sex offender they might have been able to keep him away from 9 year old jessica lunsford probation official mary doyle said couey appeared to be just one of the hundreds of citrus residents on probation for relatively minor offenses in his case drunken driving and marijuana possession had they known he was a registered sex offender they might have tried harder to find him when he failed to check in with probation officials last november she said when detectives finally caught up with him they learned he had been living across the road from jessica courts don t provide probation workers with criminal backgrounds of probationers not even for registered sexual offenders like couey doyle said  if we knew there were any important crimes they committed in the past we would probably be more diligent in keeping track of them she said the glitch was among the developments that emerged monday as law enforcement continued building a case against the 46 year old couey for the first time authorities said how jessica died asphyxiation they also said couey took her back to his mobile home after abducting her law officers officially lodged charges of first degree murder kidnapping sexual battery on a child younger than 12 and burglary with battery couey remains at the citrus county jail without bail the times also learned monday that couey worked as a mason at homosassa elementary school last year while jessica

criminal record of 24 arrests and was designated a sexual offender after a conviction for an attempted lewd act on a 14 year old in 1991 kissimmee police said citrus probation workers began overseeing couey in october 2003 when he was convicted of dui said doyle the probation official couey violated his probation aug 8 2004 when sheriff s deputies arrested him on a minor drug charge doyle said for the drug charge he got more probation for violating the dui probation the judge sent him to jail for 59 days court records showed when couey got out of jail last fall doyle said he didn t check in with probation so her office sent notices to couey s listed address 7421 grover cleveland blvd in homosassa the notices went unanswered so officials arranged for a violation of probation warrant on dec 2 that was it  there was no known reason for us to be alarmed doyle said had they known of couey s extensive criminal background doyle said they would have knocked on his door and informed the sheriff s office he wasn t living where he had registered the sheriff s office discovered couey wasn t at his home on feb 28 days after jessica was last seen by her grandparents detectives later learned couey had been living across the road from the lunsfords in his half sister s mobile home sheriff jeff dawsy said saturday he felt frustration disappointment failure for not finding jessica so close by despite scores of searchers bloodhounds and cadaver dogs searching the grounds where jessica s body was found nobody led us to that area dawsy said concerns about the tracking of sex

calling for 50 year prison sentences for sexual predators and the death penalty when a child is injured they have collected more than 10 000 signatures dawson said dunnellon resident john taylor the inventor of a gps enabled criminal tracking system used by citrus and other agencies is also working with lunsford taylor said he wants florida law enforcement agencies to use ankle bracelets on sexual offenders  i think the justice system is broke taylor said of the way the state tracks sex offenders state law requires local law enforcement agencies to periodically check where registered sex offenders say they re living but it s up to local authorities to decide when said florida department of law enforcement spokeswoman kristen perezluha fdle checks addresses of all sex offenders annually she said and those not responding to a mail survey are turned over to local authorities before jessica s disappearance couey s registered address was checked on aug 27 2004 sheriff s spokeswoman gail tierney said she did not know if another check took place later the school district is also reviewing its checks after it discovered that couey worked as a mason s helper at homosassa elementary which jessica attended a mason on the job said couey had direct contact with students and teachers during the project  oh my god said school board member ginger bryant i can t believe he ever set foot on any of our school sites while many questions about the couey case remain jessica s family can find some closure now that the medical examiner has completed an autopsy pending
