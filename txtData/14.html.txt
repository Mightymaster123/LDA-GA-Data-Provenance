being treated for a late complication of ebola is now critically ill the british nurse suffering a relapse of ebola was fighting for her life last night doctors said pauline cafferkey was critically ill at the specialist isolation unit in london yesterday and her family claimed a diabolical blunder had delayed her treatment the nurse from south lanarkshire was admitted to an isolation unit at the royal free hospital in london on thursday night four days after being sent home by doctors who diagnosed her with a virus pauline was first diagnosed with ebola in december after returning to glasgow from sierra leone via london she was critically ill and spent almost a month in an isolation unit at the royal free hospital before being discharged in late january she then started working part time in mid march as a nurse based in blantyre health centre near glasgow and had been well when she was last at work on october 1 the 39 year old is only the second patient in the world to have a recorded relapse of ebola and its severity has puzzled experts professor jonathan ball a virologist at nottingham university said this is frankly staggering  i am not aware from the scientific literature of a case where ebola has been associated with what we can only assume as life threatening complications after someone has initially recovered and certainly not so many months after virologist professor andrew easton of warwick university said that although the virus had persisted in a patient before it was unusual so long after the first diagnosis he said we haven t seen it return after this long it is concerning there are lots of unknowns at this stage it is very difficult to tell and i don t want to predict what the outcome may be pauline landed at a nearby raf base and was taken to the royal free in london for care on thursday nightthe nurse circled was diagnosed with ebola and was seen walking from an ambulance at glasgow airport as she was moved by military aircraft to london on december 30 last year she has now been struck down againtwo weeks ago ms cafferkey received a pride of britain award from lenny henry and carol vorderman in london and met samantha cameron in downing street the following day and on monday last week she met children at mossneuk primary school in east kilbride south lanarkshire to speak about her charity work in sierra leone where she contracted ebola however it was just hours after attending the primary school that she fell unwell and visited the out of hours gp clinic with ebola symptoms despite being dismissed she took herself to the queen elizabeth university hospital in glasgow on tuesday night where she was treated in the infectious diseases unit on thursday the nhs nurse was wheeled from a jet at raf northolt by medics in hazard suits on a bed surrounded by a protective bubble before being taken to the royal free yesterday a spokesman for the royal free said we are sad to announce that pauline cafferkey s condition has deteriorated and she is now critically ill ms cafferkey circled left was in downing street to meet samantha cameron circled far right 11 days agonurse pauline cafferkey pictured circled centre accepted a pride of britain award in london less than a fortnight ago from lenny henry far left suranne jones centre left and carol vorderman and far right it was later revealed that doctors missed a big opportunity to spot she had fallen ill with the potentially fatal virus for the second time her sister toni said the way her sister had been treated was absolutely diabolical she told the sunday mail at that point me and my family believe they missed a big opportunity to give the right diagnosis and we feel she was let down instead of being taken into hospital she spent the whole of tuesday very ill the first briton to contract ebola in west africa was medical volunteer william pooley from suffolk the 30 year old was flown to london from sierra leone in august last year and taken straight to the royal free hospital in london he received an experimental drug called zmapp and after making a miraculous recovery he was discharged ten days later in october last year mr pooley returned to sierra leone on another aid mission to treat ebola sufferers the other briton to contract ebola was anna cross an army reserve medic who had volunteered to work in sierra leone the 26 year old fell ill in march this year and was evacuated to the royal free where she was treated with mil 77 which is a close relative of zmapp corporal cross from cambridge was discharged from hospital after 15 days public health england said that there is a protocol for ebola survivors to be followed up by their specialist a spokesman could not comment on whether mr pooley or corporal cross had been invited to be re tested because of patient confidentiality but he added patients continue to be monitored if they are ebola survivors  i think it is absolutely diabolical the way she has been treated we don t know if the delays diagnosing pauline have had an adverse effect on her health but we intend to find out it has not been good enough  we think there have been major failings and we just want her to pull through this kind of recurrence seems to be rare but we don t yet know enough about it public health officials in scotland have identified 58 people who were in close contact with the nurse shortly before she fell ill with 40 offered vaccinations as a precaution twenty five accepted the vaccine while 15 have declined or were unable to receive it due to medical conditions officials insisted children at a primary school miss cafferkey visited hours before she fell ill were not at risk and samantha cameron who met the nurse at downing street six days earlier was also not said to be in danger three british nurses fell ill with ebola at the peak of the crisis in west africa but miss cafferkey was believed to have made a full recovery along with aid worker william pooley 30 from suffolk and army reserve nurse anna cross 26 from cambridge experts have begun to realise that in some patients the virus can linger in the body in pockets of fluid such as breast milk or behind the eye it can then transfer back into the blood stream and reactivate the only other case of this kind was american doctor ian crozier who had a relapse of ebola last year the virus had even changed the colour of his eye but dr crozier recovered and last week scientists had expected miss cafferkey to do the same because she had built up a strong immune response to the virus this is the high level isolation unit at the royal free hospital in london where pauline cafferkey is being helddr nathalie macdermott of imperial college london said this is an unprecedented situation in medical terms and an uncertain time for pauline and her family  there is still currently no proven effective treatment for ebola virus disease that would be known to prevent or manage secondary recurrence dr ben neuman a virologist at the university of reading added we don t know what ebola looks like the second time around or after a big relapse like this  right now she has had this virus about three times as long as the other previous record holder it is bad news but it is not hopeless news  as long as she is still there and as long as she is still fighting there is a chance pauline cafferkey was taken to queen elizabeth university hospital in glasgow on tuesday pictured she has since been flown to the royal free hospital in london by raf where she is being treated in an isolation unitshare
