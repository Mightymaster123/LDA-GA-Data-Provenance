Beatles in Vegas Against Long Odds - The New York Times
advertisementby allan kozinnjune 25 2006it s the beatles live in las vegas this week and for the foreseeable future well o k it s not actually the beatles performing live after all two of the fab four john lennon and george harrison are no longer among us and although their surviving partners both musical paul mccartney and ringo starr and marital yoko ono and olivia harrison are expected to be in the audience at the mirage on june 30 when cirque du soleil opens love its ambitious fantasy tribute to the band there won t be so much as a beatle cameo or a new song still cirque du soleil the canadian acrobatic troupe and apple the company the beatles started in 1967 to oversee their creative interests have joined forces for this 150 million production and they are billing it as a timeless three dimensional beatles experience that as one of its principals describes it will make the audience feel as though they are actually in the theater with the band promised too is a new soundtrack apple has given the show s two music directors sir george martin who produced the beatles original recordings and his son giles who has worked with elvis costello and kate bush free run of the band s session tapes most beatles fans would rather the tapes were mined for previously unreleased songs and upgrades of the standard albums but as giles explains apple s idea was that cirque shouldn t just be performing to a cd he adds it had to be something more unusual a new way of hearing this music what the martins produced was a 90 minute soundtrack in which classic beatles songs are remixed in surround sound sometimes combining standard versions with outtakes and even creating mash ups or versions in which riffs vocal lines guitar solos or sitar drones from one song are interposed on another next month the pair will return to london to remix the music again for a soundtrack album advertisementwhat s truly odd about all his to longtime beatles watchers is apple s enthusiasm for such innovation for much of the last 36 years apple whose four directors are the band members and their heirs has been a barricaded fortress from which volleys of lawsuits are regularly launched its response to requests to use beatles recordings in theatrical productions and films has generally been a firm no and in its zeal to protect the beatles name work and trademarks apple has sued everyone from the producers of the late 1970 s hit beatlemania to apple computer so what s going on here isn t the soundtrack to love akin to what apple so vehemently opposed in 2004 when danger mouse created the grey album a mash up of jay z s black album and the beatles white album for that matter aren t these mash ups exactly what internet based beatles fan groups have done often brilliantly though necessarily flying well below apple s radar on underground collections like mutation and the three volumes of tuned to a natural e which can be found on various download sites advertisementcould it be that in allowing cirque du soleil to base a series of fantasy tableaus on beatles music and in letting the martins take such liberties with the recordings a usually cautious company is diving headlong into the 21st century has it awakened to an era in which promiscuous remixing has made the notion of a definitive text seem quaintly academic on the other hand when apple sics its lawyers on unauthorized use of the beatles music is it really protecting the integrity of the group s work and image or is it saying we own the beatles name and music and therefore only we can compromise its integrity when the beatles started apple they described it as the antithesis of the corporate entertainment world a haven where musicians poets writers filmmakers and artists of all kinds could find support for their projects along with the beatles last four albums the company released a magnificently eclectic catalog and a handful of films but the open door policy didn t last long a parade of hucksters and freeloaders quickly drained the company s resources when the beatles went supernova in 1970 apple absorbed the immediate shock sir paul hoping to extricate himself from the partnership at first sued to have the company dissolved but later reconsidered its usefulness and for the next 19 years a tangle of lawsuits the beatles against one another and the beatles and apple against emi records were about all that apple produced those suits were settled in november 1989 and the terms were not made public one detail leaked out though emi would maintain its ownership of the recordings the beatles made for the company between 1962 and 1970 but could not release anything without apple s approval at first apple exerted this control vigorously refusing to release anything on cd beyond the standard british albums released in 1987 gradually apple began to relent two popular early 1970 s compilations known as the red and blue albums officially 1962 1966 and 1966 1970 were reissued on cd in 1993 more recently apple and emi have collaborated on new compilations like 1 a collection of beatles no 1 hits as well as the capitol versions two boxed sets so far of the group s recordings in the configurations that capitol emi s american arm released in the 1960 s meanwhile apple undertook archival projects including the beatles at the bbc and the beatles anthology a multimedia autobiography that included a 10 hour video a book and six cd s of unreleased recordings the reissue of the beatles cartoon film yellow submarine in 1999 brought with it a fully reconceived soundtrack album yellow submarine songtrack and in 2003 apple addressed the beatles mixed feelings about phil spector s production of the let it be album by releasing the stripped down let it be naked advertisementbut those were in house projects proposals from outside continued to find their way into the dustbin at apple s london offices until guy lalibert cirque du soleil s founder discovered the secret weapon friendship with a former beatle in this case george harrison in 2000 they began discussing a a collaboration using the beatles music after harrison died in november 2001 apple kept the project going it expects love to run for at least 10 years packing 2 000 people into the theater twice a night five nights a week with ticket prices ranging from 69 to 150 if the shows sell out it would be like the beatles filling shea stadium nearly 10 times a year without having to tune up or even turn up in the world of beatles obsessives the response to love has been a shrug a las vegas spectacular isn t that a little fat period elvis and a soundtrack of mash ups beatles fans just want the beatles they want things they haven t seen or heard and they want the music they have heard to sound better than it does on the available cd s they want apple to remaster the classic albums and they want those albums in surround mixes some fans would like to see the recordings available for download in court papers filed during the company s lawsuit against apple computer neil aspinall the beatles former road manager who now runs apple s daily operations said a remixing project was under way and that the group s recordings wouldn t be made available online until that process was finished he said nothing about when that might be they also want apple to release projects that have long sat on its shelf like the revamped video of the beatles 1965 shea stadium concert and an expanded bonus packed dvd of the group s last film let it be and how about a collection of the promotional films the group made in the 1960 s or dvd s of beatles concerts that were televised in paris munich and tokyo or the cd version of the 1964 and 1965 hollywood bowl concerts or the fabled 27 minute outtake of helter skelter and the avant garde carnival of light collage created for a london happening in 1967 for beatles fans an extravaganza like love looks like an unnecessary sideshow please

surprise a couple of weeks ago giles martin stopped in new york on his way to london and invited me to hear his love mixes on a five channel surround system at magno studios i was knocked out by some but i was absolutely floored by the pristine quality and fine definition of the sound with the compression of the original 1960 s productions stripped away voices and instruments seem real as if they were in the room the new mixes wrap you in the group s arrangements and let you hear long buried interplay that illuminates the beatles brilliance this is a level of detail that simply hasn t been heard outside the abbey road studios until now on yesterday you can hear paul mccartney s pick hitting the strings of his guitar and the strings snapping against the neck the guitar solo and the orchestral strings on something had similar clarity and presence and in the surround version of i am the walrus the whole kaleidoscope of textures including an extraordinarily crisp drum sound made the song quirkier than ever the mixes of revolution and come together are incomparably more powerful than the familiar versions mr starr s childlike octopus s garden gets a fantastic restructuring that begins with the string introduction to good night and then places mr starr s vocal unaccompanied in a foggy ambience using effects from yellow submarine and drums from lovely rita before the full band kicks into the more familiar arrangement and a juxtaposition of the drum figure from tomorrow never knows and the vocal line from within you without you creates a link between those mystical songs recorded nearly nine months apart the new recordings were made under the close watch of apple sir paul mr starr ms ono and mrs harrison occasionally dropped in on the martins to hear the mixes it was a little terrifying said the younger mr martin who is 36 born a few months before the beatles broke up his father is 80 when ringo came in the first thing he said was have you done octopus s garden yet paul said he liked what he heard but that we could go even farther out than we have and we ve gone pretty far and we were very concerned that yoko and olivia feel we were treating john s and george s songs well but they were both very pleased advertisementwhy do these recordings sound so immensely better than the standard cd s the martins made the love soundtrack directly from the original unmixed master tapes of the beatles sessions because of the way recordings were made in the 1960 s the beatles music as we know it both on lp and cd come from tapes that were several generations removed from those session tapes and electronically processed to make up for the limitations of 1960 s audio technology when the beatles cd s were released in 1987 these processed tapes were used for all but two of the albums sir george martin remixed rubber soul and help at the time cd mastering was in its infancy and yielded a sound that seems harsh when compared with more recent cd s which often rely directly on the session tapes the rolling stones bob dylan the byrds and even the monkees have seen their catalogs remastered to take these improvements into account but not the beatles their cd s priced at top dollar and running only about 30 harsh sounding minutes apiece look more squalid every year collectors endlessly debate what the ideal series of remastered beatles albums would be until 1999 the answer seemed clear upgraded versions of the british albums and singles in their original stereo and mono mixes there are often notable differences in instrumentation edits or vocal takes along with the handful of variant mixes released in japan australia germany and other countries but the release of the yellow submarine songtrack in 1999 made some listeners reconsider produced by peter cobbin they were updated remixes of the session tapes the resulting version of nowhere man was telling in the original stereo mix the vocals are on one channel the instruments are on the other mr cobbin spread the sweetly harmonized vocals that open the song across the stereo image to stunning effect maybe listeners began to argue an upgraded beatles catalog should take the flexibility of modern mixing into account the yellow submarine and beatles anthology dvd s added another complication some of the surround mixes were so revelatory that tech savvy fans knowing how long it takes apple to do things began creating their own surround mixes even though these amateur remixers don t have access to the session masters their versions are often surprisingly effective apple should of course get in there with its own surround series now that it has dangled teasers in yellow submarine the beatles anthology and love but if the beatles really want to be revolutionary and counteract apple s reputation for slowness and litigiousness they should take a truly bold step release the component tracks of their unmixed session tapes on dvd s with a creative commons copyright license that would allow fans to create their own remixes mash ups and recompositions for noncommercial use not that they d be the first to move in that direction two years ago david bowie offered the component tracks for songs from his reality album for download on his web site and even offered prizes including a car to fans who created the most original mash ups wired magazine has offered unmixed tracks by several bands for similar use the beatles though could be the first major group to open its archives freely and if apple was really meant to be as paul mccartney described it in 1968 a kind of western communism what could be a more natural expression of that ideal a version of this article appears in print on on page ar1 of the new york edition with the
