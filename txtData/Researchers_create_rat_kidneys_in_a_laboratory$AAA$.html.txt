Researchers create rat kidneys in a laboratory - Wikinews, the free news source
monday april 15 2013 researchers at the massachusetts general hospital have created laboratory grown rat kidneys that function when transplanted into rats according to a study published online yesterday in the medical journal nature medicine the kidneys were capable of urine production and excretion without blood clots in both the laboratory and inside living rats the researchers were able to create the functional kidneys by using a donor kidney and using a detergent to remove the rats kidney cells then used new cells to cause the kidney to grow around the remaining scaffolding the natural protein based structure of the kidney that remained after washing the kidney these kidneys would also be of the patient s tissue avoiding issues of organ rejection and would increase the pool of kidneys available for human transplant the researchers incubated the kidneys in a specialized oven for 12 days to mimic the insides of a rat the researchers reported that these kidneys produced urine at 23 of the normal levels of properly working kidneys the lead researcher of the study published in nature medicine dr harald c ott says this partial functionality is enough saying if you re on haemodialysis then kidney function of 10 to 15 would already make you independent of hemodialysis it s not that we have to go all the way the techniques developed by ott and the team of researchers still have to be further researched before it can be applied for use in humans when it comes time for use in humans ott says that pigs kidneys would be used as the templates for making human usable kidneys ott said you d take a kidney matrix off the shelf then in an ideal world you d take cells from that patient and create a kidney on demand roughly 100 000 patients in the united states need an immediate kidney transplant with 500 000 more on dialysis have an opinion on this story share it share this this page is archived and is no longer publicly editable got a correction add the template editprotected to the talk page along with your corrections and it will be brought to the attention of the administrators please note that due to our archival policy we will not alter or update the content of articles that are archived but will only accept requests to make grammatical and formatting corrections note that some listed sources or external links may no longer be available online due to age got a correction add the template editprotected to the talk page along with your corrections and it will be brought to the attention of the administrators please note that due to our archival policy we will not alter or update the content of articles that are archived but will only accept requests to make grammatical and formatting corrections
