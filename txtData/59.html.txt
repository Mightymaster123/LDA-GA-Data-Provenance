discussion around same sex marriage first began in 1993 when the hawaii supreme court ruled that laws denying same sex couples the right to marry violated state constitutional equal protection rights unless the state could show a compelling reason for such discrimination since that time many states have taken actions to clearly define marriage as a relationship between a man and a woman and others have allowed same sex couples to marry before 1993 seven states had laws that defined marriage as a relationship between a man and a woman after the hawaii court decision raised the possibility that states could recognize same sex marriage 32 state legislatures including hawaii adopted statutory language defining marriage as a relationship between a man and a woman including alaska which adopted both a statute and the nation s first constitutional provision prohibiting same sex marriage nebraska adopted a constitutional provision limiting marriage to relationships between a man and a woman as a result 40 states had statutory and or constitutional provisions limiting marriage to opposite sex couples by the end of 2000 starting in 2000 some states began recognizing same sex couples relationships in april 2000 vermont approved landmark legislation to recognize civil unions between same sex couples granting them virtually all the benefits protections and responsibilities that married couples have under vermont law the vermont legislation was a result of the state supreme court ruling in baker v vermont that said same sex couples are entitled under the state constitution s common benefits clause to the same benefits and protections as married opposite sex couples the court ruled that the vermont general assembly must decide how to provide these benefits and protections either by legalizing marriage for same sex couples or by establishing an alternative system the vermont general assembly chose to preserve marriage as the legally recognized union of one man and one woman but at the same time create a parallel system of civil unions for same sex couples that went beyond existing domestic partnership and reciprocal beneficiaries in nov 2003 the massachusetts supreme judicial court ruled that barring same sex couples from civil marriage was unconstitutional the senate then asked the court for an advisory opinion on the constitutionality of a proposed law that would bar same sex couples from civil marriage but would create civil unions as a parallel institution with all the same benefits protections rights and responsibilities under law in february the court answered segregating same sex unions from opposite sex unions cannot possibly be held rationally to advance or preserve the governmental aim of encouraging stable adult relationships for the good of the individual and of the community especially its children under this decision the state of massachusetts began issuing marriage licenses to same sex couples in may 2004 it was the first state to do so in 2005 connecticut became the second state to enact a state law providing civil unions to same sex couples in october 2006 the new jersey supreme court ordered the legislature to redefine marriage to include same sex couples or to establish a separate legal structure such as civil unions to give same sex couples the same rights as opposite sex marriage couples the new jersey legislature chose to create civil unions in 2007 which gave same sex couples the same legal rights as married opposite sex couples new hampshire legislation also created civil unions in 2007 making it the fourth state to adopt that approach on may 15 2008 the california supreme court ruled that same sex couples should have the right to marry the ruling took effect mid june and same sex marriages were performed in california for a short period of time before a ballot initiative challenging the decision was certified in late summer proposition 8 proposed a state constitutional amendment that defined marriage as a relationship between a man and a woman it passed in november 2008 again banning same sex marriage in california proposition 8 was challenged in early 2009 but the california supreme court upheld the law in may 2009 in august 2010 a federal district judge ruled that the proposition 8 ban on same sex marriages violated the equal protection provisions of the u s constitution the decision was appealed and enforcement that would allow same sex marriages to be performed was delayed until the case could be heard by the federal appeals court in february 2012 the 9th u s circuit court of appeals upheld the earlier district court decision that declared proposition 8 invalid the 2 1 decision reinstated the right to marriage for same sex couples in california the case was appealed to the u s supreme court and enforcement was delayed until the court decided in october 2008 the connecticut supreme court ruled that a ban against same sex marriage was in violation of

the measure was vetoed by governor christie the legislature had until january 2014 to override the veto with two thirds of the assembly and senate needed to do so with the state court decision in

been asked to legalize same sex marriage rather than prohibit it the measure went into effect dec 29 2012 the maine initiative and the washington and maryland referendum votes to uphold the same sex marriage laws marked a watershed they were the first instances of public votes to establish same sex marriage on the same date minnesota voters voted against a constitutional prohibition of same sex marriages those four votes reversed a long trend of public votes against same sex marriage previously voters in 32 states had consistently voted to limit same sex marriage thirty states had enacted constitutional provisions to define marriage as a relationship between a man and a woman and prohibit same sex marriages between 1998 and may 2012 only one public vote out of 32 had not supported restrictions on same sex marriage in 2006 arizona voters rejected a constitutional provision prohibiting same sex marriage and then approved a prohibition in 2008 legislative actions supporting same sex marriage continued in 2013 rhode island passed same sex marriage legislation and governor chafee signed the bill into law on may 2 2013 the bill converted civil unions to marriage and recognizes

not have jurisdiction the effect of that decision was to reinstate the federal district court decision overturning proposition 8 thus allowing same sex marriage in california amid some confusion about timing same sex marriages began shortly after the decision on the same day the supreme court decided a challenge to the federal doma law that limited over one thousand federal benefits to marriages defined as a relationship between a man and a woman it ruled that the restriction violated equal protection and due process for married same sex couples the decision emphasized the dominance of state law defining marriage and required the federal government to recognize same sex marriages granted under state law federal agencies are now working through the challenges of how to deal with same sex couples married in a state that allows same sex marriage but who now live in a state that does not allow same sex marriage the court s federal doma decision triggered a challenge to new jersey s law providing only civil unions for same sex couples the earlier new jersey supreme court decision had required the state to offer the same legal rights to same sex couples that married opposite sex couples had the federal government did not recognize civil unions as marriages so couples in a civil union could not have access to the same federal benefits the state district court ordered the state to allow same sex couples to marry but delayed enforcement of the order for three weeks to allow the state to appeal the state requested a further delay to allow it to prepare the appeal but both the district court and the state supreme court denied the request on the grounds that the state was unlikely to win on appeal the order to allow same sex marriages went into effect and governor christie
