to michael gove s plan to scrap gcses in england saying they would create a two tier system mr clegg said the education secretary s announcement was self evidently not policy that has been discussed or agreed within the coalition the daily mail said mr gove wanted to bring back a system similar to the o levels with cses for less able pupils he later told mps the current system was letting children down but mr clegg who is at an un conference on sustainable development in brazil said i am not in favour of anything that would lead to a two tier system where children at quite a young age are somehow cast on a scrap heap asked if mr gove was wrong to do what he was doing mr clegg said mr gove is entirely entitled to come up with proposals and then if he wants to we can discuss them within the government  it s really important we have an exam system that s fit for the future and doesn t just hark back to the past that it really pushes all children across the whole school system and doesn t just cater for a small number of children if the plan goes ahead students would begin studying what the leaked document says will be tougher o level style exams in english maths and the sciences from september 2014 they would take their exams in 2016 less academic pupils would sit a different more straightforward exam like the old cse the ideas if introduced would amount to the biggest change to the exams system for a generation by angela harrison education correspondent bbc newsthis leak seems to have taken officials at the department for education by surprise the timing is certainly not good with tens of thousands of teenagers in the final days of their gcse and a level exams catching headlines suggesting the government does not think their exams are tough enough if ministers decide to go ahead with the proposals and the time scale given they cannot afford to hang around the design and approval of the new exams will take time and that will come after the consultation planned for the autumn in wales and northern ireland the devolved governments will need to decide whether to stay in step with the proposed changes they could continue to let their schools choose gcse qualifications from the exam boards which are private companies following the angry reaction from lib dems downing street stressed that the plans were not there yet and were going to be put out for consultation but a senior liberal democrat source said the plan would be a huge upheaval for very modest gains the source continued the main problem we have with this is it looks like it sets far too low an aspiration for our young people  nick clegg and the lib dems do not want to return to the divisions we saw in the 1950s the source said the party would not accept a policy which would leave a large number of children behind at a relatively young age some in the party are said to feel today s newspaper report the first they knew about the plan was an attempt to bounce them into accepting the changes foreign office minister jeremy browne a liberal democrat told the bbc s daily politics what will be the guiding principle over rank and file lib dems is to have a system where everybody is able to realise their potential that you don t have glass ceilings put in at different layers but it is not just liberal democrats mps the junior partners in the coalition government with the conservatives who are unhappy with the proposals conservative mp graham stuart chair of the education select committee told bbc radio 4 s the world at one he was sceptical about changing the system of secondary school qualifications in england he said the plan had come out of the blue and asked how will it help close the gap between rich and poor how will it increase social mobility for labour shadow schools minister kevin brennan said mr gove s plan would take the exam system back to the 1950s  gcses may well need improving but a two tier exam system which divides children into winners and losers at 14 is not the answer he said mr gove was called to parliament to answer questions from mps about the leaked plans he said the current exams system needed to be improved children are working harder than ever but we are hearing that the system is not working for them we want to tackle the culture of competitive dumbing down he said rigour needed to be restored to the system if england was to keep pace with educational improvements in some other countries russell hobby the general secretary of the national association of head teachers welcomed the move towards having a single exam board per subject which he said was sensible and would remove a lot of concerns about the system  but a move to a two tier exam system does not sound a good step forward he added saying such a change would mean choices about children s futures being taken at too young an age as control of education in the uk is devolved mr gove s plans are for england only it would be up to wales and northern ireland to decide whether to follow suit in scotland pupils take standard grades highers and advanced highers rather than gcses and a levels the education minister for wales
