noida authority is bringing forward a new scheme of 400 plots for the reserved categories in sector 100 next week sector 100 is situated on the expressway according to reliable sources some political leaders were opposing the handing over of express city to private property dealers and colonisers the main plea is that farmers and entrepreneurs of reserved category will be deprived of the plots to address this grievance and objection the new scheme in the adjoining sector 100 is being brought forward for the reserved categories there will be 400 plots of different sizes in this scheme the smaller plots will be of 112 sq mt size while the bigger ones will be of 300 sq mt according to highly placed noida authority sources it is for the first time that a residential sector is being developed exclusively for reserved categories all sorts of rumours have been doing the rounds regarding nri city being converted into the express city project the noida authority has published the express city project which is being opposed by bjp leaders in all schemes brought out by the noida authority so far 50 per cent plots are for the reserved category and 50 per cent for the general category the reserved categories comprise farmers entrepreneurs and noida authority employees there is a long list of noida farmers and entrepreneurs who are still awaiting allotment for a residential plot some time ago a scheme for sectors 44 and 93 was brought forward but it became mired in controversy over 11 25 lakh sq mt land to be acquired in noida parmindar singhnoida april 1 the noida authority has ambitious plans for acquiring land this year more than seven lakh sq mt land is proposed to be acquired for residential plots this year similarly 4 25 lakh sq mt land for industrial plots is to be acquired the noida authority is expected to earn rs 1330 crore in the new financial year from the allotment of these plots accordingly provisions have been made in the financial year 2006 2007 but being embroiled in the controversy regarding a residential scheme the authority could allot only 40 000 sq mt land to a group housing society seven lakh sq mt land is planned to be sold under this category the authority has according to sources fixed a target of four lakh sq mt for the new financial year about 3 60 lakh sq mt land has been allotted in the current year as much as 4 25 lakh sq mt land is to be allotted for industrial purpose in sectors 66 and 88 some 800 residential plots are to be allotted in the new year top honours have been claimed by the institutional category which has registered the highest record the noida authority had allotted 12 lakh sq mt land in this category against a target of 4 lakh sq mt in the next financial year again a target of selling five

flyovers while rs 120 crore has been set aside for ews lig and mig flats news analysis shop sealing drive a classic catch 22 situation by raahul guleven hercules himself may find it difficult to achieve this feat even with the help of hermes and athena the mythical greek deities sympathetic to his cause it certainly doesn t look like the municipal corporation of delhi mcd is quite up to it but then when the supreme court of india tells you to do something you just got to do it no questions asked even if the order entails sealing shops and other commercial establishments functioning in residential areas of the capital a directive that s even more difficult to comply with than that of demolition of illegal constructions by delhi high court and so it was that the mcd officials commenced the shop sealing drive at the expiry of the deadline set by the apex court except that it has been one exercise whose chances of success are even more dismal than the demolition drive the reasons are not hard to see although the inhabitants of properties targeted by the mcd s demolition squads didn t exactly sit back calmly while the bulldozers and hammers got to work it wasn t their livelihood that was at stake except in a few cases like mg road but sealing shops is obviously a very different ball game altogether because here you are talking about virtually snatching away their owners sole means to feed themselves and their families not surprisingly then last week saw huge crowds in just about every locality visited by the mcd teams with many traders declaring their intentions to resist the sealing drive even if it meant bodily harm in the way of police intervention it s another thing that the police have been rather reluctant to pitch in so far as various mcd teams have been complaining despite the city police chief maintaining that that was not the case the same cannot be said of politicians on wednesday two mlas vijay singh lochhav mahipalpur and dharamdev solanki palam turned up to oppose the drive in mahipalpur haranguing the mcd officials to spare a particular showroom it couldn t be the power of votes for sure smells more like that of money as certain quarters alleged the dramatic statements emanating from former delhi chief minister madan lal khurana on the other hand would seem to be inspired by his longing to capture popular sentiment for a possible return to the capital s mainstream politics in a press conference on thursday he reiterated his burning desire to oppose the sealing drive even if he had to sacrifice his precious life because the capital was like a temple for him which he could not bear seeing being ruined like this on friday he threatened to undertake a fast unto death right outside the prime minister s residence and declared that the sealing drive was reminiscent of the partition days in 1947 he also led a crowd of about 1 500 agitated traders who actually tried to give the mcd a taste of its medicine by trying to seal its zonal office in rajouri garden he was then granted his wish of being arrested alongwith the ever faithful harsharan singh balli who on his part announced plans to gherao the residences of the sc judges who had ordered the sealing drive besides breaking open mcd seals on shops in sadar bazaar sensing the public resentment the mcd s standing committee on friday passed a resolution to include 229 additional roads in the list of residential areas where commercial activities will be permitted this comes in the wake of an eleventh hour notification issued by the urban development ministry to permit shops and offices on 118 roads the chances are good that the remaining traders will not give in to the mcd drive without pitched battles through next week and one can only hope that delhi s streets don t boom with gunfire and get soaked in blood when confrontations turn really ugly as they most likely will consumer body alleges misuse of lpg tribune news
