bedell suffered from bipolar disorder and describing him as relatively symptom free when under medication in an internet posting jpatrickbedell referred to being arrested in 2006 on marijuana charges  given my belief that cannabis prohibition is the least defensible and most unjust aspect of the prohibitionist regime existing throughout the world today i decided in march 2006 to cultivate cannabis

conspiracy is a long established reality the man said in a podcast in november 2006 which also was published as text online such an organization the man said would use its powers to convert military intelligence and law enforcement bureacracies sic into instruments for political control and the domination and subjection of society while discrediting destroying and murdering honest individuals
