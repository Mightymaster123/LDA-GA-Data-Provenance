Chinese researchers crack major U.S. government algorithm used in digital signatures - Wikinews, the free news source
wednesday february 16 2005 according to computer security expert bruce schneier a widely used cryptography algorithm known as sha 1 has been broken by three researchers at shandong university in china designed by the us intelligence agency nsa sha 1 has been adopted as an official us government standard and has become widely used in security applications worldwide notably digital signatures the three female researchers xiaoyun wang yiqun lisa yin and hongbo yu have reduced the amount of time needed to find two documents with the same signature by a factor of more than 2000 the sha 1 algorithm is used to compute a short string of numbers known as a hash for any digital document the algorithm is constructed such that small changes in the document cause the hash to change drastically by this means the hash can be used to verify that a document has not been tampered with the attack that schneier describes is a collision attack rather than the more useful pre image attack in a pre image attack the codebreaker is able to find a document with different contents that matches an existing hash and so can claim an existing signature was on something else in the somewhat less valuable collision attack the codebreaker is able to devise two documents that both have some particular hash a adversary might use this to claim that an altered document is the original on the grounds that they have the same hash a crafty adversary might also be able to trick someone into signing an innocuous document one of a pair from a collision the other document which might not be as harmless would then also appear to have been signed by the same person if collisions can be found for sha 1 then digital signatures will no longer vouch for a document s authenticity the attack for now is more of a theoretical than a practical kind it would currently take thousands of years on a modern personal computer and would still be slow even if a large number of computers were used in parallel xiaoyun wang is currently a professor at shandong university while hongbo yu is a doctoral candidate at the same institution yiqun lisa yin is currently a visiting researcher at the princeton architecture laboratory for multimedia and security palms last year xiaoyun wang and hongbo yu also took part in breaking a series of similar algorithms including the widely used md5 hash as documented in their paper presented at the crypto 2004 conference officials from the national institute of standards and technology nist have recently recommended dropping sha 1 in favor of stronger slower algorithms such as sha 256 federal computer week reported on february 7 2005 just 7 days before schneier announced the sha 1 break despite deprecating sha 1 william burr the head of nist s security technology group said that sha 1 is not broken and there is not much reason to suspect that it will be soon share this this page is archived and is no longer publicly editable got a correction add the template editprotected to the talk page along with your corrections and it will be brought to the attention of the administrators please note that due to our archival policy we will not alter or update the content of articles that are archived but will only accept requests to make grammatical and formatting corrections note that some listed sources or external links may no longer be available online due to age got a correction add the template editprotected to the talk page along with your corrections and it will be brought to the attention of the administrators please note that due to our archival policy we will not alter or update the content of articles that are archived but will only accept requests to make grammatical and formatting corrections
