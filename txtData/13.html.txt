Florida to Buy Sugar Maker in Bid to Restore Everglades - The New York Times
advertisementby damien cavejune 25 2008loxahatchee fla the dream of a restored everglades with water flowing from lake okeechobee to florida bay moved a giant step closer to reality on tuesday when the nation s largest sugarcane producer agreed to sell all of its assets to the state and go out of business under the proposed deal florida will pay 1 75 billion for united states sugar which would have six years to continue farming before turning over 187 000 acres north of everglades national park along with two sugar refineries 200 miles of railroad and other assets it would be florida s biggest land acquisition ever and the magnitude and location of the purchase left environmentalists and state officials giddy even before gov charlie crist arrived to make the announcement against a backdrop of water grass and birds here dozens of advocates gathered in small groups gasping with awe as if at a wedding for a couple they never thought would fall in love after years of battling with united states sugar over water and pollution many of them said that the prospect of a partnership came as a shock advertisement it s so exciting said margaret mcpherson vice president of the everglades foundation i m going to do cartwheels advertisementthe details of the deal which is scheduled to be completed over the next few months may define how long the honeymoon lasts previous acquisitions took longer to integrate than initially expected and because united states sugar s fields are not all contiguous complicated land swaps with other businesses may be required the purchase will be paid for with bonds and from fees already added to water bills but if the price goes up or environmental remediation enters the picture the state could have to renegotiate or find other money the fate of the company s 1 900 workers also remains in question and some former company executives have suggested that the state is overpaying bailing out a company burdened with debt a new sugar mill and a lawsuit from former employees who said they were bilked out of retirement money company officials said the deal would amount to 350 a share after taxes and other obligations were paid a premium over two previous offers of 293 per share that the company had dismissed as inadequate the accusations and concerns however did not dampen the mood even as workers from the mill in clewiston tried to get a handle on their futures and some cried foul mr crist emphasized the land s environmental value he said the deal was as monumental as the creation of the nation s first national park yellowstone declining to provide details of how the state arrived at the price of 1 7 billion he said it was a terrific bargain  i can envision no better gift to the everglades he said the people of florida and the people of america as well as our planet than to place in public ownership this missing link that represents the key to true restoration advertisementthe impact on the everglades could be substantial the natural flow of water would be restored and the expanse of about 292 square miles would add about a million acre feet of water storage that amount of water enough to fill about 500 000 olympic size swimming pools could soak the southern everglades during the dry season protecting wildlife preventing fires and allowing for a redrawing of the 8 billion everglades restoration plan approved in 2000 it would essentially remove some of the proposed plumbing many of the complicated wells and pumps the plan relied on might never have to be built water officials said because the water could move naturally down the gradually sloping land kenneth g ammon deputy executive director of the south florida water management district which will assume control of the land said it would be a managed flow way with reservoirs and other engineered mechanisms to control water flow david g guest a lawyer for earthjustice legal defense fund joked that he might have to go to blows to keep the area all natural  this is about putting it back to the way it was in the 1890s mr guest said what will happen is that if you come back here in 20 years it will look indistinguishable from the way

newsletters the future challenges will probably intersect with the land s more recent history since 1931 united states sugar has farmed the area using fertilizers that have often released phosphorous into the water the legacy of their efforts could prove hidden at first efforts to reflood and clean up lake apopka near orlando ran into trouble over the last decade when polluted sediments rose to the surface in unexpected levels the company has long denied that its efforts severely damaged the land and executives said that the sale would benefit the everglades and shareholders  it s dollars and cents and the right thing to do said robert h buker jr the company s president in an interview after the announcement if i had to go out i d rather all of us would rather it went out to make the state of florida better the company will face some hurdles the lawsuit involving former employees will not disappear but will probably include fewer plaintiffs said curtis miner one of the workers lawyers some like randy smith 57 who cashed out last year at 194 a share after 25 years with the company said tuesday s deal only proved that he did not receive his fair share  i got ripped off pretty good he said those most affected though will be current workers and they could decide whether the purchase goes through united states sugar took its stock off the public market in 1983 to create an employee stock ownership plan so technically the company is owned by the workers advertisementmr buker said he expected the workers would approve the deal because of the money they could make but at a meeting with workers in clewiston on tuesday opinions seemed mixed some workers said they were angry they were left out of the loop as recently as tuesday morning bosses told them that rumors of a sale were not true they had a lot of questions why sell now what would happen when the state took over would the mill still run would there be jobs what would happen to clewiston the tiny town that has relied on united states sugar since the 1930s mr buker tried to respond he said it was a good deal that wage earners would receive a year s pay as severance that salaried workers would get two years and he said that the company had no choice but to sell because the state had the upper hand and could have either pushed them off the land with laws rather than with 1 7 billion for many both workers and environmentalists it was all still hard to believe you got to hear it three times said chris harris 36 a united states sugar foreman after the meeting it sinks in but his voice trailed off and he looked away the company had seemed to be growing revamping its mill a new tower went up just last week at the time mr crist was being lambasted by environmentalists for reversing himself and allowing for the possibility of drilling for oil off florida s coast at least for some on tuesday all was forgiven  offshore drilling is a mouse said mr guest of earthjustice the everglades is an
