Bumper and all, Consumer Reports still doesn't recommend iPhone 4 - CNN.com
 cnn does a free case fix all the iphone 4 s problems not really says consumer reports the influential product watchdog apple ceo steve jobs on friday announced that his company will give iphone 4 owners free cases to address reception problems caused by the phone s external antenna which is a metal band around the edge of the phone mike gikas senior editor for electronics and technology at consumer reports said in an interview that such a patch is a good first step but it s still not enough for his group to recommend the phone to consumers  what we were hoping for was a concrete this is it fix for the phone gikas said consumer reports made headlines earlier this week for suggesting that iphone 4 owners would get better phone reception if they put duct tape over the bottom left corner of the phone where there was a design flaw in the antenna in an effort to address widespread complaints apple said it will give a variety of iphone 4 cases to consumers through september 30 gikas said such a solution makes it difficult to review the phone because everyone has a different case and it s unclear if the solution is permanent there s a chance the phone could still be recalled after september 30 or that a new version could be issued he said  when we test a product we try to assume this product is just like all the others that came in boxes just like it he said and we can t do that anymore with the iphone 4 because with the case this phone is different during the press event in cupertino california jobs tried to spread the blame about reception issues across the smartphone industry as a whole gikas said that was a bit unfair  the human hand the body attenuates signal on all phones he said but we haven t seen it happen to the degree that it s happened with the iphone 4 previously jobs had written an e mail that said customers should hold the phone differently if they experienced poor reception on friday jobs skirted around saying there s a problem with the phone s hardware gikas said  the most important thing to remember is a problem was discovered with the phone and we can confirm it in a lab and it was a significant problem he said  and i don t think apple fully admitted to it they acknowledged it and they threw an interim solution at it but everything spells fogginess about this thing
