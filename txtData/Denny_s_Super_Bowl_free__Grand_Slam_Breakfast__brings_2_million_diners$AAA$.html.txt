options mcdonald s has announced plans wednesday to open 175 new restaurants in china this year despite the global economic crisis thereby increasing the number of outlets in china by 17 percent from

of the grand slam i want to take back share for too long we have allowed others to take share whether it was starbucks or mcdonald s they re fine competitors and i don t expect to take all their business from them but i d like a little bit back marchioli noted according to rafi mohammed author of the art of pricing people love free it triggers a pavlovian response in people said mohammed if pavlov s dogs salivate when a bell rings denny s free grand slam breakfast has attracted 2 million hungry customers i believe free maximizes trial and doesn t devalue a product as long as it is a rare event aside from the cost the major downside is that it attracts customers who truly have no intention of coming back he added according to university of portland consumer psychology professor deana julka people flock to free promotions amid just a few dollars saving because there s nothing in life for free so when there s something out there that costs nothing it creates a psychological rush especially in these times when people feel overtaxed or overburden there s an internal reward people feel by getting something for free she said it s being thrifty and feeling like you beat the system free really hits the spot for a lot of people julka added  free is an emotional hot button when free is concerned there is no downside or at least we don t see the downside immediately so we overvalue everything that is free people love free stuff particularly when money s tight said dan ariely a business professor at duke university author of predictably irrational the hidden forces that shape our decisions experts however explained these moves need to be done sparingly since giveaways can teeter in the balance between desperation and a well designed marketing ploy giving your product away for free is not worth it because it undermines your brand value said branding expert rob frankel saying people are attached to the idea of it being free than the actual product itself free giveaways are not anything new in the food industry it just feels good when you can get something for free and not have to worry about it coming out of your wallet frankel noted dunkin donuts and panera bread all have had free coffee and food promos last year in november starbucks gave away free cup of coffee to anyone who came in on election day have you taken a look at how starbucks is doing now last week it
