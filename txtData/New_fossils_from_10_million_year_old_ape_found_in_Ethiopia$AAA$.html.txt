New fossils from 10 million year old ape found in Ethiopia - Wikinews, the free news source
thursday august 23 2007 researchers say that new ten million year old fossils found in ethiopia prove that the theory that humans may have evolved from a species of great apes eight million years ago may not be true but that humans may have split from apes as long as 10 5 million years ago at least nine fossilized teeth one canine tooth and eight molars of a previously unknown species of apes found in africa were discovered by a team of researchers from ethiopia and japan who then compared the 3 d make up of the teeth to other fossils that date back as far as 8 million years and found that the fossils are likely a direct ancestor of apes currently living in africa and that the new ape fossils were that of a species of gorilla who ate mostly plants high in fiber current fossils and research say that the evolutionary split from apes to humans occurred at least eight million years ago the new fossils say that the split may have happened as long as 10 5 million years ago  based on this fossil that means the split is much earlier than has been anticipated by the molecular evidence that means everything has to be put back said researcher at the rift valley research service in ethiopia and a co author of the study berhane asfaw despite the finds other researchers are not convinced that the findings are correct  it is stretching the evidence to base a time scale for the evolution of the great apes on this new fossil these structures appear on at least three independent lineages of apes including gorillas and they could relate to a dietary shift rather than indicating a new genetic trait said a professor at the london natural history museum in the united kingdom peter andrews who also added but the fossil evidence for the evolution of our closest living relatives the great apes is almost non existent researchers have named the newly discovered species cororapithecus abyssinicus whose remains were found in the afar region of ethiopia the same place where the remains of lucy were discovered in 1974 share this this page is archived and is no longer publicly editable got a correction add the template editprotected to the talk page along with your corrections and it will be brought to the attention of the administrators please note that due to our archival policy we will not alter or update the content of articles that are archived but will only accept requests to make grammatical and formatting corrections note that some listed sources or external links may no longer be available online due to age got a correction add the template editprotected to the talk page along with your corrections and it will be brought to the attention of the administrators please note that due to our archival policy we will not alter or update the content of articles that are archived but will only accept requests to make grammatical and formatting corrections
