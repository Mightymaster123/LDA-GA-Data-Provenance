Joblessness Inches Up to 9.8% in September - The New York Times
advertisementby peter s goodmanoct 2 2009after several months in which the american economy flashed tentative signs of improvement a sobering report on the national job market released on friday amplified worries that a lengthy period of lean times lay ahead the economy shed 263 000 jobs in september and the unemployment rate edged up to 9 8 percent from 9 7 percent in august according to the labor department s monthly snapshot of the employment picture though the job market worsened the pace of deterioration remained markedly slower than during the early months of the year when roughly 700 000 jobs a month were disappearing that improvement seems consistent with the widespread belief that the recession has given way to economic growth yet the report also buttressed fears that economic expansion would be weak and hesitant with scarce paychecks and economic anxiety remaining prominent features of american life well into next year  this is a weak report said stuart g hoffman chief economist at the pnc financial services group in pittsburgh the rate of job loss has tapered off but we still haven t reached the point where businesses are willing to hire advertisementthe labor department also made a preliminary revision in its survey of private employers that indicated the job market shrank even more during the recession the department disclosed that in march this year the economy held 824 000 fewer jobs than previously reported making an already bleak picture worse advertisementthe endurance of hard times seems likely to increase pressure on the obama administration and congress to consider another dose of spending aimed at stimulating the economy even as the government grapples with deficits projected by some economists to exceed 10 trillion over the next decade despite a 787 billion stimulus package adopted early this year and aimed in part at shoring up state and local coffers government jobs slipped by 53 000 in september  that s the budget crunch hitting said dean baker co director of the center for economic and policy research in washington we re still losing jobs at a very rapid pace we re still looking at an economy with a lot of weakness for millions of unemployed people the latest data merely confirms something they have come to understand intimately through the discouraging process of seeking work  there s nothing out there said jerry lamirande a technology systems engineer in amarillo tex who has been without a job since april 2008 during the technology boom of the late 1990s mr lamirande 62 worked for i b m where he drew a salary of about 130 000 after a layoff seven years ago he has earned about 70 000 a year as a technology consultant working on contract since the spring he and his wife have lived on her modest salary as a public school teacher and on hardship withdrawals from his retirement account he has searched nationwide for his next contract willing to relocate advertisement i ve got to go where the opportunities are he said the problem is there aren t many opportunities the latest jobs report lent credence to that contention the unemployment rate continued to inch toward double digits a level last seen in june 1983 the so called underemployment rate which includes people whose hours have been cut and those working part time for lack of full time positions along with the jobless reached 17 percent the highest level since the government began tracking it in 1994 more jobs were lost last month at 263 000 than were lost in august as the labor department revised the august decline to 201 000 jobs from the 216 000 it initially reported health care remained a rare bright spot adding 19 000 jobs in september but construction jobs slipped by 64 000 manufacturing declined by 51 000 and

economists assume the economy expanded at an annual pace of about three percent from july through september but debate focuses on the vigor and staying power of the recovery optimists anticipate a robust bounce back from what now stands as the longest recession since the great depression but most economists expect a sustained slog through high rates of joblessness the economic improvement in recent months largely stems from businesses cutting inventories at a slower pace as some companies begin to rebuild stocks the impact could wash through the economy for a few more months adding jobs and moderating the overall decline then the underlying weakness of the economy will probably reassert itself say experts after years of borrowing against homes and cashing in stock to spend in excess of their incomes many americans are tapped out austerity and saving have replaced spending and investment in many households constraining the economy as many americans transition from living on home equity loans to sustaining themselves on paychecks weekly pay continues to effectively shrink over the last year average hourly earnings for rank and file workers some 80 percent of the labor force have increased by 2 5 percent but average weekly earnings have expanded by only 0 7 percent less than the increase in the cost of living because employers have slashed working hours advertisementin september the average workweek edged down by one tenth of an hour to 33 hours for those out of work the job market looks harsher now than at any point in the recession the number of people who have been jobless for more than six months increased in september by 450 000 reaching 5 4 million  we have a truly massive crisis of long term unemployment said christine l owens executive director of the national employment law project in a statement adding that nearly 400 000 jobless people had exhausted their unemployment benefits by the end of september today s employment report is a marching order for congress to pass unemployment benefit extensions to all states quickly the first signs of improvement are likely to be seen among temporary workers say experts as companies now hunkering down in the face of uncertain prospects take tentative steps to expand but temporary help services lost 1 700 jobs in september  companies are extremely cautious said roy g krause chief executive of spherion a recruiting and staffing company based in fort lauderdale fla all of which translates into continued apprehension in many households  it s terrifying said stephanie wheeler 56 of elizabeth n j who
