President Obama will clinch renomination Tuesday, but it may not be unanimous | NOLA.com
by jonathan tilove the times picayunewashington the ap reports that with primaries tuesday in connecticut delaware new york pennsylvania and rhode island president barack obama will secure enough delegates to guarantee his re nomination at the democratic national convention in charlotte in september the only question is whether obama s re nomination will be unanimous and that rests in part on whether chattanooga tenn attorney john wolfe jr can successfully sue the louisiana democratic party to force it to give him the three or more delegates he appeared to have won in the state s binding march 24 primary on that score wolfe has won an ally in darcy g richardson who finished fourth behind obama wolfe and bob ely in the in the primary and considers it petty and undemocratic that the party is denying wolfe the right to claim his delegates because he failed to identify an authorized representative in the state and failed to file a statement of full participation with the party  shamelessly resorting to this kind of obscure technicality to deny mr wolfe the three delegates that he legitimately won on march 24 reflects poorly on both the national and louisiana democratic party an organization that proudly embraced the recommendations of the mcgovern fraser commission broadening participation and inclusion in the party s nominating process in the aftermath of the disastrous convention in chicago in 1968 said richardson a floridian who writes about politics at uncovered politics how is the party in any way damaged if mr wolfe receives a handful of votes on the first ballot in charlotte in the state primary president obama won 76 percent of the vote wolfe won 12 percent ely won 7 percent and richardson won five percent but in three of the state s seven congressional districts wolfe won more than 15 percent of the vote which under party rules entitled him to a proportional share of delegates from those districts when the delegates themselves are chosen at the party s may 5 congressional district caucuses the state party subsequently announced that wolfe was not eligible for any delegates because neither he nor for that matter ely or richardson had filed the authorized representative or full participations documents obama did file the two documents the sept 21 presidential campaign full participation plan simply commits the candidate to conduct an open process and strive for demographic balance in his delegate slate the second document which was inadvertently dated dec 6 2012 instead of 2011 identifies kip wainscott counsel and director of delegate operations for the obama campaign as its authorized representative in louisiana  i think the louisiana democratic party is putting the screws to wolfe on a flimsy technicality said richardson who has suspended his own campaign for president unlike texas where i submitted a full participation statement at the time of my filing for a spot on the may 29th primary ballot i was completely unaware that a similar statement was required in louisiana said richardson nobody in the party or the secretary of state s office informed me of that requirement nor did i see it on the party s website  moreover the notion that a candidate was also required to name an authorized representative for his campaign in louisiana is ludicrous said richardson most minor candidates serve as their own representatives while it might make sense to communicate with the president s representative in the state any communication from the party to most other candidates should be made directly with the candidate and not some representative certified beforehand according to the statement issued by the state party last monday both rules are included in the louisiana delegate selection plan that has been publicly available online via the louisiana democratic party s website since april of 2011  it s distressing to watch a party that has historically fought for the weak and powerless resort to seemingly trivial technicalities to silence any opposition obama should be embarrassed that he has to rely on flimsy technicalities to win unanimous re nomination said richardson hell even richard nixon s nomination in 1972 wasn t unanimous antiwar challenger rep paul mccloskey received a single delegate in new mexico while republicans denied a seat at the convention to the delegate mccloskey won rep manuel lujan r new mexico a nixon loyalist cast a vote for mccloskey to keep faith with state law shortly after the louisiana primary richardson wrote texas democratic officials to ask that they remove wolfe from that state s primary ballot because he argued wolfe s failure to file any campaign finance reports with the federal election commission violated that state party s loyalty oath but a state party official replied to richardson we cannot remove someone from the ballot because of fec violations the question at issue is whether wolfe has exceeded the fundraising and spending thresholds that require him to file reports with the fec which has said he will eventually do that spat aside richardson and wolfe are both liberal critics of the president wolfe expects to file suit in federal court in baton rouge later this week to try to win the delegates he earned in the primary but come what may in louisiana wolfe believes he has good opportunities to pick up some delegates in the arkansas primary may 22 and texas on may 29 where as in louisiana he can tap into a lack of enthusiasm for the president in the low turnout votes  there are delegates to be won in texas and arkansas said wolfe registration on or use of this site constitutes acceptance of our user agreement and privacy policy 2018 nola media group all rights reserved about us the
