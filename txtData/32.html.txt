Jade Rabbit lunar rover dies on moon | World news | The Guardian
afp agencywednesday 12 february 2014 13 55 est last modified on friday 15 january 2016 08 35 estchina s troubled jade rabbit lunar rover has died on the surface of the moon state media reported on wednesday posing a big setback for the country s ambitious space programme the first moon rover sent out by china could not be restored to full function the state owned china news service said in a brief report the landmark mission had run into mechanical problems last month the jade rabbit or yutu in chinese was deployed on the moon s surface on 15 december and was a huge source of pride in china only the third country to complete a lunar rover mission after the us and former soviet union the landing was a key step forward in beijing s ambitious military run space programme which includes plans for a permanent orbiting station by 2020 and eventually person sent to the moon the silver rover had a mechanical control abnormality late january due to the complicated lunar surface environment according to the official xinhua news agency it had been unable to function since then condolences poured in on weibo china s twitter like service where internet users mourned the demise of the rover china news service said in its brief report entitled loss of lunar rover the jade rabbit rover had sent back its first photographs from the moon and officials lauded the first lunar soft landing in nearly 40 years as a step forward for mankind as a whole the lunar mission which came 10 years after china first sent an astronaut into space was seen as a symbol of the country s rising global stature and technological advancement as well as a communist party success in reversing the fortunes of the nation beijing plans to establish a permanent space station by 2020 and eventually send a human to the moon the potential to extract lunar resources has been touted as a key reason behind beijing s space programme the moon is suspected to hold uranium titanium and other mineral resources and could offer the possibility of solar power generation sign in or create your guardian account to join the discussion this discussion is closed for comments we re doing some maintenance

summary 6229 they should have taken out the extended warranty it may have gone to the moon but it s still a hoover i bought one of these on ebay from seller singkong 876 357 sales at 99 4 positive feedback and it didn t work but got a replacement in 11 days made in chinasold in aldishame it took a lot of hacking to get that thing up there those without the brain still can t achieve this feat even with everything available crikey they must be hopping mad i had a hutch you d say thati suppose they were living on burrowed time with something that complicated if only they d used duracell batteries you gloat at their small setback but i gloat at your ignorance the technicians must be pulling their hare out okay i ll stop now please stop it s probably a software bug s bunny i ll get me coat what a damn shame still at least it returned some photos and data and their lunar lander is still operating hopefully the chinese will learn from this mishap and produce a superior rover for the chang e 4 mission in 2015 rocket science is hard they will learn and the next one will be better it is a quite impressive accomplishment none the less it is too bad we can t all work together and share our knowledge too bad indeed still competition drives space exploration just as much as co operation as the space race proves as for me i hope china goes a bit further than the moon perhaps to venus a planet that s been neglected for some time amateurs i managed to set up a mun colony in kerbal space program step it up china but how many kerbals had to die eh how many kerbals had to die so that you could have your colony jebediah died for you and you have to live with that it is poignant and strange how this article in its use of the words died and demise bestows the status of a living being to a robot lunar rover at the moment the use of such terminology may seem inappropriate but the idea of it being used is enough to make me wonder as to how we are beginning our approach to the outlook of asimov s bicentennial man or lem s cyberiad even at present to me they seem to have far more life than corporations and thus more rights to a legal living status it s nothing more than a computer on wheels it s not alive i guess that space probes carry more than just intricate circuitry and cameras in their robotic shells they also carry the actions enthusiasm and hopes of hundreds perhaps thousands of people who were involved in their construction and operation not only that but all space probes become the ambassadors of the human spirit wherever they are sent it s not too difficult to see how a collection of metal and plastic can gain a certain feeling of life attached to it when so much emotion and value is placed on it if you were to see landers at work without being able to see those controlling them you would certainly observe an intelligence in their actions which must feel as if they were somehow living so i do find myself sad at the demise of any space programme including poor jade rabbit it s death is little more of note than a kettle with a blown fuse but to those who have worked so hard to get it as far as it got i m sure it feels like a whole lot more i wish china more successes in the future some probes get rather more exciting endings http en wikipedia org wiki galileo_ 28spacecraft 29 end_of_mission_and_deorbit http en wikipedia org wiki magellan_ 28spacecraft 29 end_of_missionbetter to burn out than to fade away sorry folks but i can speak from experience and i can assume that many of you have never done anything like this or you would understand when you work for years on a very hard project like this you become very attached if you are a good engineer you give them names you dream of them at night you watch them take their first breath their first steps and at three o clock in the morning when you solve a particularly hard problem it can be better than sex so you mourn when they die nothing to do with jade rabbit lover right it sounds like a thermal regulation problem the landing site in the bay of rainbows like nearly everywhere else on the moon experiences 2 weeks daylight and 2 weeks night time the punishing temperature gradient between the two is over 200 degrees c indications are that the rover survived the day period but then conked out in the cold there s no guarantee that china will tell the world about its failures but it s come clean on this one and in any case china s had a lot more success with this mission than the uk had with its beagle shot at mars so well done china hope you beat the americans back to the moon and stir uncle sam into action mars is a much harder problem fyi in case you do not know how to dig up some info before you yap your mouth the temperature difference between days and nights on the moon is some 250 degree centigrade and that of the mars is less than 100 this means as far as keeping any electronics in working order moon presents a much bigger challenge one of those ovni s flew over and zapped it you re not welcomethe first moon rover sent out by china could not be restored to full function that may be the official line but who s to say that it isn t fully operational and quietly but slowly and surely working away to form the basis of china s ultimate goal which is to turn the moon into its very own death star with which to control the world don t say i didn t warn you thanks for warning me i will immediately start building the x wing fighters and r2d2 s we re going to need to defeat them may the force be with you rebel scum apparently a death star would cost about 852 000 000 000 000 000 and since you can blow one up with a small one man fighter it s not terribly practical what wait i m hearing yutu may have survived so it s not certain at this point that the rover has died guardian check your sources before making a definitive announcement you really can be unbelievable sometimes kaput like everything i have bought over the last few years that is made in china they re lucky it stayed in one piece for as long as it did unlike the products i ve bought that being far from inexpensive have literally fallen to pieces within the day week or a month china s biggest export shoddy manufacturing say your iphone toosurely that would be gunpowder without it you or any white person would not be in the privileged position to have such a complex to mock others as if they hadn t contributed to the evolution of man also worth pointing out that if you recognise the pattern of continual failures from made in china goods why do you keep buying them sounds like you re the sucker here or just lying how many ncap stars did the thing have china wanted to take close up pictures of the moon some 40 years after the russians did it i think the chinese should stick to making cheap clothing and table ware so basically know your place chinese leave the good stuff to the whites hell where do you people come from you do know this is 2014 not 1993 ever heard of xiaomi lenovo huawei the fastest computer on the planet the world s first 3d tv that doesn t require glasses the world s lightest useful man made material the most flawless space programme up to now of recent years where ve you been a time capsule how many ncap stars did the thing have china wanted to take close up pictures of the moon some 40 years after the russians did it i think the chinese should stick to making cheap clothing and table ware that s one small step for mao one giant loss for nanjing they should made it out of metal instead of jade jade is toooo heavy you know what your problem is you re just too jaded i m not nephritened by that remark is that the asbestos that you can do the silver rover had a mechanical control abnormality late january due to the complicated lunar surface environment you have to wonder what this constipated bureaucratese is an embarrassed euphemism for it hit a bump it fell down a hole it toppled over i think the eyelids for the solar panels had a chinese moment probably made a lot of sense in original mandarin and then someone translated it translate traduce to paraphrase the italian wow how s that for casual racism this is tragic i don t care what country it is all honest efforts to explore the universe beyond this planet should be applauded my sincere condolences go out to the chinese i agree but that doesn t mean i m averse to taking the piss and making stupid puns yes indeed this stuff is hard and they did well on a first attempt which makes it all the more impressive that mars opportunity is still working so well 10 years into its 90 day mission that s not a crow to say nasa usa better than china it s just to say that some stuff that engineers do is truly amazing yes this jade rabbit is truly inspirational for humankind everywhere but i wish chinese pollution wouldn t contribute to california pollution and i wish fukushisma radiation wouldn t contribute to north america either in 6 years they plan to have a habitable space station err not likely after a glitch with the small jade rabbit the space station would be 1000x more complex needing technology beyond their abilities unless they acquire expertise from the russians another faller at the first hurdle you do know they already have a small space station orbiting the earth astronauts have already been in it you do know that up to now the chinese space programme has been flawless unlike all the russian rocket failures or the uk s beagle that simply died on impact where ve you been this story is premature and a big setback only for afp s credibility for the current situation see http www planetary org blogs emily lakdawalla 2014 possible hope for yutu htmlnone of the rovers built after say 1969 we re that much good the journalist who wrote this story must be found and arrested for er criticising public officials or something china issued an embarrassing news report today turning ears red announcing that its jade rabbit yutu in chinese moon explorer has made its last hop sources reveal that the lunar rover was going to be named march hare but members of the ultra secret inner sanctum tea party thought that would be mad unfortunately the iron rice bowl technology used extensively in the design and assembly of the lunar vehicle was not up to the demands of the moon s riceless environment and had bugs in its software while the full extent of the project s failure has been revealed only to higher ranking communist party officials known as thumpers lower party pipkins and regular citizens will be given just the fluffy tail of the story they will be told only that the jade rabbit has gone into its hole on the moon and is sleeping it is unknown if china will attempt another voyage to the bunny planet as the death of the jade rabbit seems to be a portent of bad luck for dragonland s space program code named rabbit s foot another yank this blog is flooded with americans jumping in joy over china s mishap how pitiful the americans
