1608 the remains of the peloton which contains most of the riders fancied to win the tour cross the line approximately three and a half minutes behind the stage winner injury concerns alexandre vinokourov and andreas kloeden came through the stage without obvious worry with another difficult stage on sunday the favourites have kept their powder dry 1606 david de la fuente crosses the line in third place one minute 38 seconds behind gerdemann 1603 linus gerdemann takes the stage and with it claims the yellow jersey a fantastic achievement for the 24 year old t mobile rider fabian cancellara s time in maillot jaune has come to an end gerdemann also takes the lead in the white jersey competition awarded to the best young rider in the race it is the greatest win of his career fantastic seconds later inigo landaluze of the euskadi team crosses the line 1554 linus gerdemann has a lead of 20 seconds over inigo landaluze with eight kilometres left it won t take long to reach the finish given the speed he is descending as things stand he is heading for yellow 1551 the peloton reaches the summit three minutes 20 seconds behind linus gerdemann a steep technical descent follows 1547 linus gerdemann is in big trouble first he almost hits a motorbike just swerving out of the way and then manfully drags himself up to the summit of the col de la colombiere reaching it 18 seconds ahead of inigo landaluze 1545 inigo landaluze continues to pursue linus gerdemann up the col de la colombiere gerdemann has a lead of more than four minutes from the chasing pack and could well end the day in yellow all the big hitters though in with a realistic chance of winning the tour appeared to be in the peloton 1543 an update on alexandre vinokourov and andreas kloeden the injured astana duo are in the peloton and look to be in good shape 1538 linus gerdemann remains in front but inigo landaluze is now in second after chasing him down with david de la fuente before dropping the saunier duval rider 1536 rabobank continue to drive the peloton it is a hot hot day in france and some of the field are really suffering the sprinters gave up the ghost some time ago and formed their own bus at the back 1528 linus gerdemann decides the time has come to take matters into his own hands and drops dmitriy fofonov he does so with 20 km left or to put it another way five kilometres to the top of the col de la colombiere the pursuing peloton has upped the pace and are shedding riders in a big way 1521 dmitriy fofonov and linus gerdemann have a lead of four minutes on the main field they look comfortable relatively speaking rabobank are driving the peloton perhaps denis menchov fancies his chances the lead two are eight kilometres from the top of the climb 1514 dmitriy fofonov and linus gerdemann lead the breakaway group of 15 is effectively no more spread as they are on the mountain likewise the peloton has thinned out but the climbers within it are hardly travelling at top speed it will be fascinating to see who is where when they go over the top 1510 of the 15 in the breakaway group jose ivan gutierrez takes off and is soon joined by david de la fuente paolo savoldelli disappears out the back joins the two at the front of the breakaway group one thing is for sure fabian cancellara will not be in yellow tonight 1506 there are 30 points for the first man to climb the col de la colombiere which has an elevation of 3 000 feet it is 16 km long and by the end of today s stage we will know a lot more about who is in the sort of shape to challenge for the overall classification or perhaps more pertinently who is not 1502 the business end of the day the breakaway group of 15 have started to climb the col de la colombiere expect the entire field to be spread all the way up the mountain the sprinters are already amassing at the rear of the peloton 1452 of the breakaway group caisse d epargne rider jose ivan gutierrez is the highest placed in the overall standings 53 seconds behind fabian cancellara linus gerdemann is 52 seconds adrift and juan antonio flecha one minute 1445 ok so the miles are ticking down to the col de la colombiere and the breakaway group of 15 have a lead of six minutes 19 seconds the group of 15 are martin elmiger juan antonio flecha dmitriy fofonov david de la fuente jose ivan gutierrez linus gerdemann inigo landaluze laurent lefevre egoi martinez ruben perez jerome pineau paolo savoldelli bram tankink fabian wegmann benoit vaugrenard savoldelli will win this stage gerdemann will take the yellow jersey de guzman on 6061435 several sprinters including robbie mcewen who is having a difficult old day after slipping off the back earlier in the stage rejoin the main peloton several csc riders continue to drive the peloton 1430 david de la fuente hoovers up more points crossing over the top of the category four cote de peguin in first place with laurent lefevre second and dmitriy fofonov third 1426 there are 60 km left in the stage and the breakaway group have a lead of 5 minutes 40 seconds the sun is beating down and the time until the riders reach the col de la colombiere is coming down all the time 1409 several csc riders are pulling along the peloton as they attempt to close the gap on the breakaway group their jerseys are unzipped and they are working hard it is hot hot hot on bastille day 1405 david del la fuente bursts off the top of the breakaway group of 15 to reach the summit of the third category cote de cruseilles first lets face it what we are all waiting for is to see what happens on the category one col de la colombiere then we ll find out for real just what sort of shape astana s injured duo of alexandre vinokourov and andreas kloeden are in 1350 the peloton has reduced the lead of the breakaway group of 15 to 5 minutes 32 seconds there are 80km remaining and the food station has been and gone 1335 the breakaway 15 are now 7 minutes 32 seconds ahead of the peloton the riders have covered more than half the stage but the category one climb over the col de la colombiere lies ahead 1314 it has been reported that enrico degano who crashed on stage six has abandoned according to reallywheelie on 606 this leaves isle of man rider mark cavendish as the lanterne rouge that s last place to those of us not too familiar with french 1305 t mobile s linus gerdemann sprints off the front of the breakaway group to take six points at the second intermediate sprint the breakaway group of 15 riders are still eight minutes clear of the peloton rest assured though there will be many more twists and turns before the end of this stage 1255 the breakaway group now comprises 15 riders with a lead of more than eight minutes over the peloton there are 120km left in the stage and the field are closing in on the second and final sprint of the day the first was won by tom boonen with erik zabel second and daniele bennati third 1245 the breakaway group of 12 now have a lead of more than five minutes over the peloton while another three are attempting to cross the divide 1235 lots of talk on the 606 board about christophe moreau s chances of sending france into raptures with a bastille day victory but can he deliver surely he is over the hill pardon the pun 1230 the group including race leader fabian cancellara has caught the main peloton which includes all the pre race favourites moving forward to the tete de course three riders have bridged the gap and joined the breakaway group 1225 it is a very very hot bastille day and if the first climb of the day is an indicator of what lies ahead the field will be blown to pieces the breakaway group of nine riders including saunier duval s david de la fuente have a lead of 36 seconds over the peloton 1205 drama the first climb of the day and the field has split into two main groups with a smaller breakaway group out in front race leader fabian cancellara and green jersey leader tom boonen are adrift of the main group as are robbie mcewen and mark cavendish dane michael rasmussen was first over the cote de corlier the opening climb of the day before falling back into the peloton with euskaltel euskadi s gorka verdugo second 1200 a group of riders pulled off the front of the peloton at the 24km mark but by time they reached the first climb of the stage the 6 4km cote de corlier they had been swallowed up by the peloton don t forget today is bastille day expect lots of attacks from the french riders as they go in search of glory 1130 the stage has started and the riders are through the first 15km andriy grivko launched an early break but was soon reeled in by the peloton speaking earlier on saturday morning danish climber michael rasmussen highlighted the importance of the stage
