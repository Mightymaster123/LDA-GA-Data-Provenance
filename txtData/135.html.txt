Apple Offers Free Cases to Address iPhone Issue - The New York Times
advertisementby miguel helftjuly 16 2010cupertino calif many expected a mea culpa from steven p jobs apple s chief executive instead he turned the iphone 4 s antenna problems into a marketing event on friday at a news conference at apple s headquarters here mr jobs acknowledged that there were issues with the antenna which wraps around the outside of the device but he insisted that the problems which can result in dropped calls when the device is held a certain way affect all smartphones a claim that was challenged by some apple competitors and he accused the news media of exaggerating the scope of the issue saying customers and reviewers were thrilled with the new phone  this has been blown so out of proportion that it is incredible he said mr jobs said that to put the controversy behind it apple would give free bumpers cases that wrap around the rim of the phone and seem to reduce the problem of dropped calls to all iphone 4 buyers who want them advertisementthose who have already bought the cases will be reimbursed and customers who are still not satisfied can return the phones for a full refund the cases will remain free at least until sept 30 when apple will consider whether it can offer a different solution advertisementsome marketing experts said mr jobs had been effective at deflecting a potentially damaging crisis and predicted apple would suffer little damage from the antenna ruckus  it is inexcusable that this problem was not found out in advance said peter sealey a former chief marketing officer of the coca cola company who teaches at the school of management at claremont graduate university but he said mr jobs did what he needed to do he is the best marketing guy in america and this is just a bump in the road mr jobs offered some contrition he said apple was not perfect and apologized to customers affected by the antenna problem we are human and we make mistakes sometimes he said but he quickly went on the offensive saying every smartphone suffers from similar problems to bolster his case he showed videos of smartphones including a blackberry an android powered phone and a windows mobile device that dropped signals when they were held in certain places when a reporter said he could not replicate the signal drop on his blackberry mr jobs said the problem was only evident in places where the signal is weak most of all mr jobs said time and again that the iphone 4 was the best phone apple had shipped and that most reviewers believed it to be the best smartphone on the market he said he had evidence to back his claims first only one in about 200 buyers had called apple to complain about antenna issues a historically low number he said what s more he said that return rates at at t the exclusive carrier of the iphone in the united states were 1 7 percent or less than a third the return rates of the iphone 3gs advertisementmr jobs conceded that the iphone 4 suffered from a slight increase in dropped calls over the iphone 3gs but said that the increase was less than one additional drop for every 100 calls he would not provide absolute numbers of dropped calls but he said that he believed the increase was because fewer

rivals took issue with the contention that all smartphones suffer from antenna problems karen lachtanski a spokeswoman for nokia said in an e mail message that antenna performance can be affected by a tight grip but added that s why nokia designs our phones to ensure acceptable performance in all real life cases for example when the phone is held in either hand sanjay k jha motorola s co chief executive said in a statement that his company had avoided putting antennas on the outside of its phones because consumers don t like being told how to hold the phone mr jha said it was disingenuous
