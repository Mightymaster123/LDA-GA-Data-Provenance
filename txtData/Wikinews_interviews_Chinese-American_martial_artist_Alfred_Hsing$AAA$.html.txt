brought on by the world teemeah do you have an idol or role model in martial arts a hsing when i grew up my dad rented a lot of jet li and jackie chan movies as i got to learn more about how hard working and dedicated they were they became more of an inspiration to me and motivated me to challenge myself to my limits teemeah now you live in china do you consider to stay there or would you move
