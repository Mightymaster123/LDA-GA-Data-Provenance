Asian countries call for global currency - Wikinews, the free news source
monday april 6 2009 leaders and central banks in russia china malaysia indonesia thailand and kazakhstan have called for an international currency system speaking on april 1 in advance of the g 20 summit in london russian president dmitry medvedev argued that the international finance system needed a new construction including new currency systems saying that such a new system could be the purpose of a revamped imf and world bank the imf was originally founded in 1946 as the overseer of the bretton woods system which from its founding until the 1970s tied the western world s currencies to the us dollar which was in turn backed by gold russia s proposal was for the new currency to serve as a reserve currency one which would take the place of the dollar euro and other heavily traded currencies as an international standard of exchange medvedev s comments are a reversal of russian position from a lukewarm response following a looser outline for a worldwide currency by kazakhstani president nursultan nazarbayev on march 11 nazarbayev suggested the establishment of the acmetal a portmanteau of acme and capital as a reserve currency replacing the ruble in international transactions first for central asia and then worldwide 1999 economics nobel laureate robert mundell speaking to the daily telegraph endorsed the idea saying it would be a very good idea if the g 20 took that idea up in london 2001 nobel economics prize winner joseph stiglitz meanwhile said the new currency could come about quickly if it was based on an expansion of the imf s already established system of special drawing rights units of exchange used by the imf which already have some of the features of currency stiglitz argued that as the us dollar has become the standard global reserve currency it has inadvertently created a system which hurts the world economy it s a net transfer in a sense to the united states of foreign aid he argued reasoning that when other countries purchase us dollars in order to use them on international markets such as for the buying and selling of petroleum they effectively give the us a zero interest loan sometimes at times when they can least afford it stiglitz made his comments as head of a united nations panel of economists giving recommendations to address the global financial crisis in the weeks leading up to the g 20 conference the people s republic of china also began discussing a new system for reserve currencies in a march 23 speech zhou xiaochuan governor of the people s bank of china endorsed a new reserve currency saying the desirable goal of reforming the international monetary system therefore is to create an international reserve currency that is disconnected from individual nations and is able to remain stable in the long run thus removing the inherent deficiencies caused by using credit based national currencies zhou went on to endorse the expansion of the sdr system in the long term creation of a reserve currency government by the imf while zhou did not mention the us dollar specifically analysis by qu hongbin chief china economist for hsbc for the financial times said that the speech is a clear sign that china as the largest holder of us dollar financial assets is concerned about the potential inflationary risk of the us federal reserve printing money china holds 740 billion as assets inflation in the us economy which has been low in recent years would directly cause those assets to lose value while the chinese government has engaged in currency swaps with several other growing economies such as south korea argentina malaysia and indonesia the chinese yuan cannot be used itself as a reserve currency as it cannot be freely traded on the global market the chinese russian proposal was not entered onto the agenda at the g 20 meeting itself nonetheless british prime minister gordon brown said that the g 20 was open to considering the proposal if and when a detailed one is presented united states president barack obama meanwhile endorsed the continuation of dollar supremacy saying that the us dollar is extraordinarily strong and arguing that its strength was the result of the intrinsic stability of the united states economic and political system us treasury secretary timothy geithner had the week before made comments that while he supported an expansion in the sdr mechanism he rejected the idea of a global currency rather than change the role of sdrs the g 20 meeting instead added 250 billion in support to the fund backing sdrs after the g 20 conference ended on thursday malaysia s the star bizweek reported that the central banks of indonesia malaysia and thailand had endorsed the chinese proposal all three countries have close economic ties with china and suffered heavily from the collapse of their currencies in the 1997 asian financial crisis the sudden growth in the value of the us dollar relative to those countries native currencies sharply increased debt in southeast asia s economies leading to a wave of bankruptcies international reaction from other economies has been mixed and guarded luiz inacio lula da silva president of brazil said that the currency proposal was important to discuss but did not give extensive comment and while upi reports that india supported the sdr proposal at the g 20 conference the indian press trust quotes indian prime minister manmohan singh as saying last month it is too early to talk about common currency calls for an independent global reserve currency are not new in 1944 john maynard keynes proposed the bancor a unit like the sdr supported by a basket of commodities keynes idea was rejected and the us dollar took the equivalent role under the bretton woods system keynes proposed that the bancor system would be reinforced by a tax on participating countries current accounts the difference between their exports and their imports in order to encourage balanced trade meanwhile monetary unions have become more popular since the end of the gold standard with most of the european union now trading the euro and several countries outside the eu using it as a de facto currency five west african countries adopting the eco at the end of this year and the african union planning to introduce the afro in 2028 proposals for a north american currency union based around the so called amero have been frequently discussed as the focus of conspiracy theories in the united states but none of the us canada or mexico have actively pursued the establishment of any such monetary union however
