by julian gavaghan updated 08 45 edt 2 september 201115view commentsthe toxic legacy of 9 11 was laid bare today as it was revealed that firefighters exposed to fallout from the attack are 19 per cent more likely to get cancer the emergency workers are among 60 270 people at risk after inhaling dust and fumes following the collapse of the world trade center in new york city and almost ten years on it was also revealed that 18 462 people last year were treated for being exposed to various cancer causing compounds deadly cloud the dust generated from the collapse of the twin towers contained a mixture of cancer causing agents including lead from 50 000 pulverised computers and mercury from countless more light bulbsamong the lethal mixture of carcinogens was lead from 50 000 pulverised computers and mercury from countless more light bulbs doctors now fear that the lasting legacy of 9 11 will be a generation with health problems and many more deaths matthew mauer of the new york state department of health said reports of persistent health effects are a sobering reminder that the disaster has had far reaching effects  one cannot help but wonder what will be reported when we mark the 20th anniversary of this tragedy dr john howard the 9 11 federal health director accepted some people could have died from 9 11 related illnesses but has yet to shift from the position outlined in july where he concluded in a report that there was not yet enough evidence to support a link between the attacks and cancer he told bbc news night i think undoubtedly there are people who have succumbed in the interval between now and september 11  i think it is plausible that many people will die of the many conditions we ve seen due to their exposure at risk firefighters exposed to 9 11 dust are 20 per cent more likely to suffer from cancer a study foundchoking people seen masking their mouths from the pitch dark dust run world trade center s collapseyet without the direct official link to cancer firefighters and other rescue workers cannot receive payments for cancer treatments under the james zadroga 9 11 health and compensation act the law named after the first known victim to die from health problems related to the dust covers illnesses like asthma and other respiratory diseases but not cancer mr zadroga himself a father who served as a detective with the new york police department died from a rare lung disease in january 2006 aged 35 the non smoker who had no known history of asthma or other respiratory conditions spent 450 hours participating in the recovery efforts at ground zero recalling the day he died his father joe zadroga a retired police commander yesterday said i went up to his room one morning to check on him and he was dead on the floor he was so young but unlike lung diseases cancer can take up to 20 years to develop and many doctors believe the specific risk is being overlooked while a future time bomb ticks away the findings of yesterday s study by the fire department of the city of new york which was published in the lancet medical journal may now help pave the way for federal health benefits for rescue workers with cancer victim police officer james zadroga right died from a lung disease after spending 450 hours at ground zerolegacy mr zadroga with his daughter inspired a new law enacted this year to compensate ill 9 11 rescue workers this study clearly shows world trade center exposure in these firefighters led to an increase in cancer said fdny researcher dr david prezant firefighters working in the rubble of the world trade center after two planes hit its twin towers on september 11 2001 were exposed to a several known cancer causing agents including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons polychlorinated biphenyls and dioxins the cancers are various but the most common were those of the skin prostate thyroid and non hodgkins s lymphoma studies so far have not found an increased risk of lung cancer which takes many years to develop and this study was no exception finding no increased risk of lung cancer for exposed firefighters versus those not exposed prior studies have shown increased rates of post traumatic stress disorder asthma and other respiratory illnesses among rescue workers to date only a handful of smaller studies have shown increased rates of cancer dr prezant said he was not sure whether his report would be enough to make the case for federal health benefits for firefighters who developed cancer after the 9 11 attacks but said dr howard who is tasked with making the decision is aware of his study dr prezant said the study had several strengths including the fact that it looked at nearly 10 000 male firefighters fighting fro his son retired police chief joe zadroga left has fought for others like his son james to receive compensation for their work at ground zero however the james zadroga act does not cover cancer victimsthe team only looked at cancers that developed in the first seven years after the world trade center attacks comparing rates among exposed and non exposed firefighters and they made several adjustments to the overall groups to exclude information that might skew the results for example they excluded data on 576 firefighters who were over age 60 on september 11 because the small number of men in that age group would have made the results statistically unstable they also excluded data on 32 women 13 asians and 8 native americans for the same reason and they excluded data on 85 men who had a prior cancer diagnosis after adjusting for these factors they found the exposed firefighters had a 19 per cent higher rate of having any type of cancer  this shows an increase in all cancers dr prezant said adding the study was not designed to show increases in a particular type of cancer waiting until definitive studies have been completed would be unfair and would pose a hardship for workers who willingly risked their health by responding without hesitation to the wtc crisis he said share what you thinkthe comments below have not been moderated the views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do
