in the historic central square of the capital on saturday in a show of strength that suggested he would use huge street demonstrations to put public pressure on the court to grant his request for a recount  we cannot accept these results mr l pez obrador 52 declared we are going to ask for clarity we are going to ask for a vote count polling place by polling place mr l pez obrador s determination to challenge the results means that a special federal electoral tribunal set up to handle electoral disputes will end up deciding whether there will be a recount some legal scholars said that while that outcome was unlikely it was not impossible mr l pez obrador said the election had been riddled with irregularities and the official count could not be trusted he and the leaders of his party of the democratic revolution complained that during the official tally on wednesday and thursday local election officials had ignored demands that boxes of ballots be recounted from polling places that they thought had unusual results aides to mr l pez obrador said he would argue in court that a recount was needed because poll officials had tossed out large number of ballots 904 000 because they could not tell the intention of the voters these null votes could be enough to change the results of the election they said mr l pez obrador is also likely to point out that in the few cases where election officials did recount votes during the official tally mistakes had been found many of those mistakes hurt mr l pez obrador and benefited mr calder n they said but announcing the vote luis carlos ugalde the chairman of federal electoral institute maintained that electoral officials had complied with the law and guaranteed that the votes of mexicans have been counted with absolute transparency advertisementmr l pez obrador s decision to hold a rally on saturday revived concerns of continued political turbulence the populist former mayor has a history of using marches to protest what he has considered fraudulent elections that did not go his way he also used large demonstrations to beat back an attempt to knock him off the ballot with a legal challenge last year  building a democracy has cost a lot in this country and we are not going to give it up easily said federico arreola a campaign adviser to mr l pez obrador there is no reason for l pez obrador to back out or defend a system that he doesn t belong to the federal electoral institute released the final vote count on thursday it will submit the count to the electoral tribunal for approval on sunday usually a pro forma process mr l pez obrador then will have until monday to present his case for a recount officials at the electoral institute said mr calder n a technocrat campaigned on promises to

obrador came up fast ended in a dead heat with the former mayor and according to the official tally won by a nose the election was the most competitive and transparent in mexico s history and it polarized the nation between haves and have nots the confusing results kept the country in suspense and to some revived concerns over the soundness of the electoral process from a not too distant past when elections were marred by fraud and manipulated by the state some political analysts said that unless there was a full and open recounting of the ballots mr l pez obrador s legal challenge could permanently taint the legitimacy of a calder n government or lead to unrest  the culture of fraud is still so strong that unless there is a recount it is going to be impossible to generate confidence in the system said denise dresser a political scientist at the autonomous technological institute of mexico jos antonio crespo who sits with ms dresser on a citizen s committee at the federal electoral institute agreed it is the best way to dispel any doubts about whether felipe won that decision will likely fall into the hands of the electoral tribunal a court of seven magistrates who are nominated by the supreme court and approved by the senate for 10 year terms created 15 years ago to review complaints about state and federal congressional elections its powers were expanded in 1996 to cover presidential elections and its findings are final the tribunal s decisions have made sweeping changes on the political landscape in the last 10 years the court has annulled gubernatorial elections in the states of tabasco and colima and it has imposed multimillion dollar fines for illegal campaign financing advertisementbut challenges to presidential elections are unprecedented in mexico so this like many parts of electoral law will be tested for the first time legal scholars say there is nothing in the election law providing for a recount but there is nothing prohibiting it either the tribunal has the power to order any number of ballot boxes opened to make its decision lorenzo c rdova a legal scholar who specializes in election law at the national autonomous university of mexico said annulling the election would be possible but improbable under current law a presidential election can be annulled only if the military had intervened or the party in power had exerted influence he said yet he said the tribunal would have to break new ground in deciding on a recount whatever the outcome he said it would be better than the old system under which the government declared who had lost and candidates had no legal recourse  it is natural that there are complaints in an election as close as this one he said what would be worrisome is if there were not legal mechanisms and all we had were the streets a version of this article appears in print on on page a1 of the new york edition with the headline conservative wins in mexico in final tally order reprints
