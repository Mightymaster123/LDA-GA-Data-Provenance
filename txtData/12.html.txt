Scottish parliament votes to legalise gay marriage | Society | The Guardian
severin carrell scotland correspondenttuesday 4 february 2014 15 01 est last modified on friday 22 january 2016 07 27 estthe first same sex weddings in scotland could take place in october after msps voted by a majority of 87 to legalise gay marriage the vote passed by 105 to 18 came after the scottish parliament voted down several attempts to amend the bill to add extra protections for religious celebrants who opposed the new law the amendments were backed by up to 21 msps chiefly catholic and baptist churchgoers but alex neil the scottish health secretary argued there were already robust protections for religious organisations and celebrants  we have always maintained at the heart of this issue there is one simple fact a marriage is about love neil said all couples in scotland in a loving relationship must know that they have the same rights and responsibilities and regardless of their gender the same opportunity to get married religious bodies will be allowed to carry out same sex weddings if they formally opt in to the legislation individual celebrants who still reject the reform after their churches introduce it will be protected after the uk government agreed amendments to the equalities act gay and civil rights campaigners were jubilant with the result tom french policy co ordinator for the equality network said this is a profoundly emotional moment for many people who grew up in a country where being gay was still a criminal offence until 1980  scotland can be proud that we now have one of the most progressive equal marriage bills in the world and that we ve sent out a strong message about the kind of country we are colin macfarlane director of stonewall scotland said it was a historic moment we re delighted that msps have overwhelmingly demonstrated that they re committed to building a scotland fit for the 21st century he said scotland will become the 17th country and legislature around the world to introduce same sex marriage the first in england and wales are due to take place this march scotland s first marriages are expected this autumn after ministers promised to rush through the legal powers the two main churches the presbyterian church of scotland and the roman catholic church have opposed the reform alongside other faiths and churches including muslim leaders more than 50 ministers and church officials wrote to the scottish government expressing their deep concern before the vote the multi faith scotland for marriage group said more than 54 000 people had signed a new petition opposing the law by monday evening opponents of the measures fear that equalities legislation could be used to force public servants such as registrars or schoolteachers to support gay marriage christian msps pressed for clauses stating for the avoidance of doubt that marriage is between one man and one woman they believe churches could be refused funding or council buildings if they are known to oppose same sex marriage john mason an snp msp and baptist tabled several amendments to bolster the statutory rights of opponents of same sex ceremonies including one stating that no one could be compelled by any means to solemnise a gay marriage  if the parliament accepts none of these amendments this afternoon we are sending out a signal that we ve not been listening mason argued richard lyle another snp msp said prospective foster carers could be turned down if they opposed same sex marriage what is more likely yet not less tragic is that applicants with so called traditional views on marriage will be put off applying in the first place fearing they will be branded homophobic he said that argument was resisted by jim eadie also an snp msp speaking as someone who is both gay and adopted i believe this amendment is both discriminatory and unnecessary because it singles out beliefs about same sex marriage of being worthy of protection why should other beliefs not be similarly protected for example a belief that divorce is wrong jackson carlaw the scottish tory deputy leader said there was a celebratory attitude during the holyrood debate and wholeheartedly supported the new legislation  there has been a huge change in my lifetime from the brutal atmosphere that existed in respect of gay people when i was a teenager and a young man he said but i regard today as a fantastic celebratory change in the mood

doing some maintenance right now you can still read comments but please come back later to add your own commenting has been disabled for this account why a great day well done our scottish parliament indeed leo homosexuality was still a crime when i joined the police in scotland and i was shocked when i realised i d joined an organisation that was effectively controlled by viciously homophobic men those same men were also racist sexist and sectarian claimed to be christian and enjoyed being on duty at certain parades or football matches although those men gradually decreased in number some were still there when i was forced to take early retirement 20 years later their hate now hidden beneath a thin veneer of tolerance but if they thought you were one of us that veneer quickly disappeared the law changed in scotland in 1980 but attitudes within my force didn t and we actually had teams set up to target gay activists in the capital well into the 80 s i saw one of those same now elderly men standing holding a placard outside holyrood yesterday still filled with hate and intolerance probably still ranting that the bible says and still being very selective in his quotes from that book what those christians always avoid is that their rule book also says women are inferior to men should be treated as possessions that the punishment for non belief adultery and a host of now accepted behaviours beliefs is death and that that punishment applies to children too anyone who justifies their homophobia by saying it s in the bible should read what comes before and after that particular law and then explain why they no longer support all those other laws just the one that demonises lgbt people i watched most of yesterday s debate and it was superb most many of the 18 who voted against did so because of concerns about safeguards i know that john mason and others aren t opposed to gay marriage and only one female msp had me shaking my head in disbelief at her barely hidden hate i actually found myself applauding jackie baillie s response and only one female msp had me shaking my head in disbelief at her barely hidden hatewee mags mitchell surely not she s probably got loads of gay friends some of whom are obviously her best friends too and they do lots of lovely things for her like select antiques and er decorate her bathroom yep that s scotland on hold for ye brilliant news a round of applause for all involved and to all those who can now begin planning an october weddingan october wedding in a newly independent scotland priceless not likelycongratulations let the scottish rain fall outstanding well done the scottish government hurrah well done the scottish parliament it s great news and it s another nail in the coffin of religion i hope well it shouldn t be really as its got naff all to do with them if they don t want to offer their services to same sex couples of course i do expect their narcissism to kick in and they ll be crying me me me shortly cue religious whining don t implicate all religious people though please i m religious and i m delighted with this news why isn t this headline news scotland s just passed a major milestone in equality and all we re worth is a few paragraphs come on because a ceo who no one s ever heard of said a couple of things that suggested there would have to be discussions about sterling and a monetary union when scotland votes yes that meant it became the lead item on bbcnews 24 bbc scotland radio scotland and sky news and the most significant change in scottish society for at least a generation was relegated to a soundbite and where was the graun i thought the guardian was supposed to champion civil rights and equality scotland only merited a tiny little subsection bravo boys and girls bravo the graun only champions such things when it fits with its agenda it now seems promoting anything regarding scotland at this time is taboo in much of the main stream media the graun is certainly a fully paid up member with its onslaught of anti independence articles it is a great shame that the paper i favour ed has with the independence debate been exposed as being just as poor as others i decry it is the right decision at the right timei don t see this as a swipe at traditional values and i hope their fears prove unfounded a decision to celebrate without triumphalism i was watching the closing speeches definitely got a strong sense that the msps listened to the public and recognised that a healthy portion of scottish voters across all age groups and backgrounds support full marriage i m still waiting for the ukip approved floods and earthquakes mind minnesota rejected a constitutional amendment to permanently ban same gendered marriage in 2012 and repealed the law banning it in 2013  and all we ve had is 40 s wind chills lots more snow the local archbishop turning into a lustful cockmonster and lusting after david cameron  let s see ukip do a wi calendar pose tomorrow outdoors somewhere in lake woebegon they would do with a dandelion to cover the naughty bits not a sunflower  i had typed sane gendered marriage before correcting and people who love each other and want to be married are both completely sane and completely crazy regardless of genders involved smiles there something to be proud of gay marriage has been legal in some countries for years for example canada as far as i an tell canadian society hasn t collapsed as a result some of the things religious opponents of gay marriage say about it are are silly no rainstorms of frogs realy i thought canada devolved into some mad max style wasteland battered by extreme gay onduced weather dod ukip lie to me psame sex marriage has been legal in spain since 2005 and as with other countries who were the first to bring it in such as the netherlands there is not the slightest evidence of an effect on traditional marriage or that it is causing social collapse we got there i m so pleased it s less than 30 years ago i was forced to leave scotland because of the bigotry regarding my sexuality the change in the country has been remarkable if celebrants can opt out because it offends their religious beliefs can i opt out of paying tax because it offends mine seriously why should i pay taxes to help upport an institution i e religion that promotes ignorance faith over evidence and bigotry over love and compassion why should i pay taxes to help upport an institution i e religion  i m not really sure what you mean by this bit the english bishops in the house of lords at long last the return of traditional gay marriage that was around for over two thousand years before christianity even existed until it came along and outlawed it on pain of death let s hear it for traditional marriage anyone who s actually studied the history of marriage in scotland and the uk will soon realise that real marriage was the preserve of the wealthy and powerful until fairly recently for most handfasting type relationships were the norm and that included gay and lesbian couples indeed like most of today s traditional christian beliefs and practices it was the supremely hypocritical and cruel victorians where were responsible for most of it they also turned mythology into historical fact and those facts were still being taught when i studied history in the 50 s and 60 s i always think it s fun to point out that traditional marriage doesn t mean what those using the term think it does catholic marriages were illegal in britain before the mid 18th century after all so they don t want to go that far back in tradition just as far back as suits them and no more to add my tuppence worth to yours dorice s comments as a genealogy geek i ve spent more time than a sane person could reading mostly scottish betrothal marriage contracts disputes from about the 15th right up to the 19th century there re really no mention of marriages in churches till a very late date the emphasis was on the contract between the two families families as dorice says who had land civil rights or property to transact it is fairly common to see other sorts of contracts like land sales and the rights that went with them being done at the altar before notaries became common i ve never formally studied history so it s only my impression but it s a pretty overwhelming impression that the primary motivation for the transition to marriage by a priest or in churches was that people wished their childrens marriage contracts to be rock solid and indisputable especially to exclude existing sprogs by formal or informal partners so that the inheritance of those children born in wedlock and the alliances between the families would be safeguarded it s only around the reformation that clergymen seemed to give a damn whether ordinary folk or even the burgess minor gentry classes being married at all by the time the last culdees faded out their canonical successors already seem to have adopted the idea of clergymen with wives in all but name all the centuries pre reformation as far as my genealogy takes me every other churchman that i have found seems to have offspring hence names like mctaggart macpherson macvicar mccleary and a whole load of respectable burgesses who were just named in english or gaelic johnson or davidson or whatever schir or maister had for a first name the fact that priests couldn t marry was no impediment whatever to their having a family or in many cases a family life there is no detectable stigma in the records just legalistic difficulties in inheritance and disputes about which of the deceased s property was personal or belonged to the church very many priests were themselves the offpring of priests who as a class were the gentry with a career in place of a conventional inheritance clergy with de facto marriages or bidie oots and offspring as an unabashed norm understanable when you remember that it was an incredibly violent society by our present standards however rich you were the only nurses and police you really had were family what s touted as traditional marriage two folk marrying for love and the church involved as well you see amongst the lower non property owning classes first is something that accompanied the struggle over reformation town records have a spate of ordering weddings between solidly respectable citizens who ve lived together for years in scotland as far as i can see the motive of love was not the norm amongst wealthier people at least in their first marriage until well into the 19th century nor was a traditional wedding traditional even after written records became essential if you got wed in church in the 19th century it was often at the end of the regular sunday church service even in the early 20th the records show that getting married at the bride s home was still very common witnesses were necessary to the performance of a marriage but clergymen never were the last such marriage by declaration in my family was recorded by the civil registrar two years later about 1930 being left handed being black or being gay is just as natural it is a sometimes rare occurrence to fall in love and to hold that person in your heart and be loved in return it is something that should be celebrated if it is love between two guys or two girls all the better it takes even more courage to defend that love yes people are born red haired left handed gay lesbian black brown white and blue eyed hate homophobia racism sexism sectarianism and religious belief is taught superb news a victory for equality and plain old common sense i always thought the scots were staunch upright supporters of traditional religious and moral values must be going soft as well  religious and moral values aren t the same thing what s a traditional religious moral value that we should stone someone to death for working on the sabbath that we should suffer not a witch to live spare the rod and spoil the child fortunately we are growing up as a nation and leaving the barbarism of the bible behind and if that means we re going soft then good we should be more kind and loving towards all of our fellow men and women and not discriminate against them if they do not follow the right god with rules that were written down two thousand years ago in another country and another language for a different people religious belief is disappearing faster in scotland than england as the last census proves fewer than 350 000 attend religious services regularly and regularly according to both the cos and rc churches means attending 3 or more times every year the population is now 5 3 million most marriages are non religious and faith schools apart from 3 episcopalian and one jewish primary school all faith schools are rc are closing year on year there are no free schools or academies religious or otherwise either oh and 430 000 of that population is english like me with a further 160 000 describing themselves as non scottish holyrood is secular westminster is coe why don t you know that finally and i don t mean the passing of the bill that s just common sense but that i managed to find this story on the guardian site it wasn t anywhere to be seen on the mobile site too often i find myself complaining that the guardian only acknowledges scotland s existence during the festival and i m an englishman living here yes that is noticeable on here australia is more prominent than scotland on this site i was struck too by the lack of prominence i know scotland gets scanty news coverage generally in the guardian but this is not just socially but historically significant one reason is because there is a vote on scottish independence this year promotion of scotland in anyway is few and far between in the main stream media at the moment and indeed historically this would bring recognition of what we have achieved with devolution of power and in turn the great potential we have as a fully independent nation and so the lead story is a personal opinion from a bp exec burying this truly historic momentous and positive change for scotland that the guardian should be shouting from the rooftops jackson carlaw isn t likely to get many favourable references in the guardian either atl or btl but he deserved his namecheck here his tory colleague mary scanlon also spoke well acknowledging that she was one of the many people who have moved to supporting equal marriage in recent years i wish i could find it in myself to say something anything nice about those who spoke against but i can t so rather than spoil the good mood i shan t say anything wish i could find it in myself to say something anything nice about those who spoke against but i can t so rather than spoil the good mood i shan t say anything and now scotland can be proud to be a nation where the law does not uphold bigotry i can t find anything other than your names are out there in the public eye for all to see so prepare to explain yourself this goes double strength for john mason from what i ve heard a deeply unpopular and unpleasant man at parliament made worse by behind the scenes shenanigans clearly referenced in one of his many speeches yesterday where he referred to strained friendships and a man who was elected on a tiny majority of only 586 votes margaret mitchell her rambling and quite frankly offensive speechifying as to why equal marriage is teh ebil nearly caused my seeing globes to dislodge from the optic nerves i can t help but wonder what their respective party leaders are thinking of them now and the less i say about alex johnstone a classic speech of some of my best friends are gay so i can t be called homophobic even though my speech is laden with it ugh hurray for scotland very progressive and civilized indeed nice to read good news for a change go the jocks thrilling news which makes me proud to be a scot not everyone was pleased the rev david robertson said those of us who do not accept this redefinition of marriage and hold to the traditional view which has been the building block of our society mourn this day because we believe that ultimately this will be detrimental to the people of scotland especially the poor and marginalisedso has the anti argument shifted from this will damage traditional marriage to this will damage the most vulnerable i m still waiting to hear how that might happen i wouldn t hold my breath if i were you we are still waiting for an explanation on how it will damage traditional marriage i wouldn t hold my breath if i were yougood advice and there aren t some poor and marginalised gay couples who for the first time if they wish can formalise their loving relationship by getting married what a nonsensical statement cross party democracy at its very best congratulations to all concerned and good luck to our gay and lesbian friends who ve been recognised as having the right to marry who they want to consensus at holyrood happens more than the guardian torygraph will ever admit it s not news minimum pricing unified police and fire services and many more policies bills pass with almost all party support that s because of the committee system used at holyrood all the evidence all the amendments all the wheeling and dealing sunset clauses and changes are made in committee before they are debated in the main chamber the reason this bill took longer than the westminster equivalent was because the evidence gathering and presentations at the committee stages and the public consultation was more extensive and wide ranging and interestingly even though the consultations was longer no one from the anti squad could still come up with a reason why it shouldn t be allowed well that s put a bloody big smile on my face not that i expected anything less from scotland fantastic stuff anyway
