Michael Geist inflates pending lists claim to vilify record labels | Barry Sookman
prof michael geist is no lover of the recording industry in fact he uses every opportunity he gets to slag and demonize it like a professional propaganda expert his attacks use exaggeration misleading information and half truths to achieve his obvious ends prof geist went on a cross country blitz yesterday with his blog canadian recording industry faces 60 billion copyright infringement lawsuit and toronto star article record industry faces liability over infringement over the chet baker suit as if something new has happened with the case in fact the case was started in august 2008 not october 2008 as asserted by prof geist it also hasn t only been going on for the past year as he claims chet baker isn t about to add a new claim to fame despite having started over a year and a half ago the class action case hasn t even been certified yet so why the fervour to publicise the case now prof geist tries to taint the recording industry as blatant copyright infringers without ever delving into the industry wide accepted custom for clearing mechanical rights the pending list system which has been around for decades represents an agreed upon industry wide consensus that songwriters music publishers who represent songwriters and the recording industry use and rely on to ensure that music gets released and to the market efficiently and the proper copyright owners get compensated the agreement the mechanical licensing agreement or mla defines the respective obligations of music publishers and record labels to identify the proper rights holders and make sure they get paid when music is released in english language canada a similar agreement is negotiated with quebec music publishers the record labels have specified reporting requirements to provide the necessary data to identify proper rights holders and the cmrra and their quebec equivalent sodrac which act as agents or collectives for the songwriters and publishers take the information provided by the labels identify the proper rights holders issue licenses to the labels accept payment from the labels and distribute the royalties to the proper rights holders in many circumstances rights are directly licensed or pre cleared so the pending list system never even comes into play the pending lists regime is used to help resolve unidentified or unsettled potential claims that are not automatically identified or settled songs can end up on the list for many reasons for example ownership is still being determined by the cmrra ownership is disputed between one or more music publishers or songwriters the owner can t be found a song may be in the public domain the ownership may be unknown or in dispute an individual song may contain numerous samples or snippets of other songs and sorting out ownership can take years in some cases the money earmarked to be paid to someone is set aside in a pending list the money is reserved pending the identification of the unidentified writers in the meantime all rights holders including songwriters and music publishers want to get the music out to consumers and earning royalties as soon as owners are identified or claims resolved the publisher gets paid and the claim is removed the pending lists system represents a remarkable degree of flexibility on the part of all music industry stakeholders who in the interests of getting music to consumers quickly permit the reproduction of music in return for a pre agreed compensation when proof of entitlement is made this internationally accepted practice benefits musicians labels songwriters publishers retailers radio stations and consumers in his blog prof geist claimed that the canadian recording industry has a potential liability that exceeds 60 billion of course nothing could be further from the truth the mla the industry wide agreement between music publishers and the record labels values the publishers and songwriters rights in sound recordings it is such a well established rate that the copyright board uses it as a proxy in fixing royalties for other uses of music there is no conceivable way that the pending lists could produce such a staggering price tag using the mla further as prof geist must know canadian courts cannot award statutory damages of 20 000 per infringement under the copyright act as he claims given the number of songs alleged to be on the list it is also a mathematical impossibility that any judgement could be anywhere in prof geist s stratospheric calculations we all know that lawsuits almost always overstate their claims in the interest of maximizing a potential return yet prof geist uncritically reports a potential claim that is surreally high as if it was a fact well exaggerated headlines gets people s attention so why not just make numbers up won t people just believe what they read anyways when it comes from a research chair in internet and e commerce law at the university of ottawa yesterday prof geist admitted in a twitter posting last evening that his calculations were an embarrassing math error he made a similar admission in an updated blog posting however by this time his inaccurate and misleading blog and toronto star article had already been widely disseminated and syndicated through the web to thousands of people including by readers of the toronto star new york post zdnet billboard business news zeropaid tg daily techdirt eye weekly and torrentfreak it is fascinating to observe prof geist s sudden epiphany about rampant infringement in the music industry he has repeatedly opposed copyright reforms that would better equip copyright holders to enforce their rights against bittorrent and other file share networks and services several weeks ago he led a frenzied propaganda campaign attacking the anti counterfeiting trade agreement acta see fear mongering and misinformation used to slag acta two weeks ago he made disingenuous use of statistics to argue that canada is a low piracy country see oecd counterfeiting report misinterpreted to support myth of canada as a low piracy country now he makes an embarrassing math error in trying to make news out of an old claim against the recording industry posted in copyrighttags barry sookman chet baker copyright geistyou can follow any responses to this entry through the rss 2 0 feed you can leave a response or trackback from your own site commentnameemailnot publishedwebsitecaptcha code notify me of follow up comments by email notify me of new posts by email thanks for providing an alternative viewpoint however i think you ve rather missed the point the plaintiff asserts that the pending list system is being used in an unreasonable manner to defer or avoid payment of mechanical royalties you assert that as soon as owners are identified or claims resolved the publisher gets paid and the claim is removed however to my knowledge there are no searchable pending lists made available to artists nor is this information publicly audited it appears to be a case of the fox guarding the hen house here s the thing you say the pending list system represents an agreed upon industry wide consensus that songwriters music publishers who represent songwriters and the recording industry use and rely on to ensure that music gets released and to the market efficiently and the proper copyright owners get compensated well excuse me but how is that any different from p2p what you re saying is that it s a system where you commit copyright infringement and later decide on honoring copyright to blatantly disregard copyright when it s deemed inefficient is highly hypocritical and ethically suspect especially when stronger penalties are being pushed for if i want to use a copyrighted work i have to go get a license first if i don t i get sued for infringement why is it one rule for us and another for the industry let s boil it down to bare facts this list is nothing more than a documented list of works used without licenses found it is a list of copyright infringements as the people behind the list are those that have pushed for the heavier punishments ethically they should face the strongest after all you re the ones crying you need the penalties but you re also the heaviest infringers  further as prof geist must know canadian courts cannot award statutory damages of 20 000 per infringement under the copyright act as he claims except i just looked at the law page 60 of the copyright law states 38 1 1 subject to this section a copyright owner may elect at any time before final judgment is rendered to recover instead of damages and profits referred to in subsection 35 1 actual damages an award of statutory damages for all infringements involved in the proceedings with respect to any one work or other subject matter for which any one infringer is liable individually or for which any two or more infringers are liable jointly and severally in a sum of not less than 500 or more than 20 000 as the court considers just that looks like 20 000 per infringement to me also 38 7 says 7 an election under subsection 1 above does not affect any right that the copyright owner may have to exemplary or punitive damages basically the law says that it can be 20 000 per infringement contrary to your claim and that more damages can be awarded as well at the end of the day the law is the law it trumps any agreement you ve made especially as it s a law you ve been lobbying for and wanted to make stronger thank you for clarifying that it is normal industry practice to not care so much about the letter of the copyright law but rather pay out royalties when the proper clerical procedures have come to their ends in the meantime we will continue the normal citizen practice of not caring so much about the letter of the copyright law but rather give our custom to companies that do not chronically screw both artists and creative fans and instead promote culture both in action free sharing and politics oh and in the meantime we will also rewrite the letter of the copyright law to put the first kind behind bars rather than just suing them cheers rick falkvinge the pirate party lawmakers thank you for your comment there is a major difference between a practice agreed to by users the labels and rights holders the publishers and songwriters that permits distribution under a contract to pay royalties to the person entitled and users who simply decide that they can copy when it is obvious there is no consent thank you for your comment there is a major difference between a practice agreed to by users the labels and rights holders the publishers and songwriters that permits distribution under a contract to pay royalties to the person entitled and users who of p2p systems simply decide that they can copy when it is obvious there is no consent it is no 20k max per infringement if you look at the wording quoted by you above you will see it says an award of statutory damages for all infringements involved in the proceedings with respect to any one work or other subject matter so if there are 100 copies made of the same sound recording each is an infringement but the most that can be recovered for all such infringements in one proceeding is 20k form action subscribe unsubscribeemail address back to top 2018 barry sookman proudly powered by wordpress green park 2 by cordobo
