Search Is On for Wreckage of Missing Air France Jet - The New York Times
advertisementby donald g mcneil jr and christine negronijune 1 2009the disappearance of an air france jet en route from rio de janeiro to paris on sunday evening left seasoned crash investigators with a mystery to plumb and very little data to work with the airbus a330 200 carrying 228 passengers and crew members is believed to have vanished in a towering thunderstorm with no word from its pilots that they were in crisis the plane had beamed out several signals that its electrical systems had malfunctioned and according to one report that it had lost cabin pressure the signals were sent not as distress calls however but as automated reports to air france s maintenance system and were not read for hours until air traffic controllers realized that the plane s crew had not radioed in on schedule as a search for wreckage began over a vast swath of ocean between brazil and the african coast experts struggled to offer plausible theories as to how a well maintained modern jetliner built to withstand electrical and physical buffeting far greater than nature usually offers could have gone down so silently and mysteriously there were no suggestions on monday that a bomb a hijacking or sabotage was to blame whatever of the plane s final minutes was recorded in its black box may never be known because it is presumably at the bottom of the atlantic as is common with trans ocean flights it was too far out over the sea to be tracked on land based radar from brazil or senegal whether its location was captured by satellite or other planes radar is not known yet the plane flight af 447 was scheduled to arrive at charles de gaulle airport at 11 10 a m local time stricken relatives descended on terminal 2d where the airline established a crisis center a black robed priest was making his way past hordes of police officers and journalists to comfort relatives of those on the flight  air france is extremely distraught and the whole team of air france is suffering pierre henri gourgeon the chief executive of air france klm told reporters in paris we would like to say to the relatives of the victims that we are totally with them and will make every effort to help them president nicolas sarkozy of france said it s a tragic accident the chances of finding survivors are tiny there were people of 32 nationalities aboard including 58 brazilians 61 french and 2 americans air france said in a statement based on information from brazilian authorities the flight took off from rio de janeiro at 7 30 p m local time 6 30 p m eastern time and its last verbal communication with air traffic control was three hours later at 10 33 according to a statement from brazil s civil aviation agency at that time the flight was at 35 000 feet and traveling at 520 miles per hour about a half hour later it apparently encountered an electrical storm with very heavy turbulence air france said the last communication from it came at 11 14 a series of automatic messages indicating it had suffered an electrical system malfunction the associated press reported that it also suffered a loss of cabin pressure brazilian officials said the plane disappeared over the atlantic somewhere between a point 186 miles northeast of their coastal city natal and the cape verde islands off africa the area is known as the intertropical convergence zone where the tropics of the northern and southern hemispheres mix sometimes creating violent and unpredictable thunderstorms that can rise to 55 000 feet higher than commercial jetliners can go experts were at a loss to explain fatal damage from lightning or a tropical storm both of which jetliners face routinely despite efforts to avoid them as much out of concern for passengers nerves as for the planes safety pilots are trained to go over or around thunderstorms rather than through them brigitte barrand an air france spokeswoman said the highly experienced pilot had clocked 11 000 flying hours including 1 100 hours on airbus 330 jets  a completely unexpected situation occurred on board the aircraft mr gourgeon told france s lci television  lightning alone is not enough to explain the loss of this plane julien gourguechon a longtime air france pilot said turbulence alone is not enough  it is always a combination of factors mr gourgeon said by some estimates jetliners are typically hit by lightning at least once a year but the strike normally travels across the plane s aluminum skin and out the tail or a wingtip passengers are insulated in the nonconductive largely plastic interior and vital equipment is shielded a loss of cabin pressure could suggest a break in the fuselage but planes are built to withstand buffeting from a storm s updrafts and downdrafts it could also be a consequence of an electrical failure

aircraft was relatively new having gone into service in april 2005 its last hangar maintenance check was on april 16 air france said no airbus a330 200 passenger flight ever had a fatal crash according to the aviation safety network hans weber head of the tecop aviation consulting firm in san diego offered a hypothesis about the episode based on his knowledge of severe losses of altitude by two qantas jets last year the new airbus 330 was a fly by wire plane in which signals to move the aileron rudder and elevators are sent through electric wires to small motors rather than through cables or hydraulic tubing fly by wire systems can automatically conduct maneuvers to prevent an impending crash but some airbus jets will not allow a pilot to override the self protection mechanism on both qantas flights the planes inertia sensors sent faulty information into the flight computers making them take emergency measures to correct problems that did not exist sending the planes into sudden dives if the inertia sensor told a computer that a plane was stalling forcing it to drop the nose and dive to pick up airspeed and there was simultaneously a severe downdraft in the storm turbulence that would be hard to recover from mr weber said because of an editing error an article on june 2 about the disappearance of an air france jet en route from rio de janeiro to paris misattributed a quotation about possible causes and rendered it incorrectly the comment was by julien gourguechon a longtime air france pilot not by pierre henri gourgeon the chief executive officer of air france klm and it should have been rendered as two separate statements lightning alone is not enough to explain the loss of this plane and turbulence alone isn t enough rather than as one statement the article also misidentified the area where the plane disappeared over the atlantic ocean it is known as the intertropical convergence zone not the horse latitudes the horse latitudes are north and south of the intertropical convergence zone and the article misidentified the parts of the plane that were likely to be of concern in case of electrical failure during flight those are the aileron rudder and elevators not the flaps the flaps are used in takeoffs and landings donald g mcneil jr reported from new york and christine negroni from greenwich conn reporting was contributed by
