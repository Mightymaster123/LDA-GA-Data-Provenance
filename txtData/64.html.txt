Finally! The Galaxyâ€™s Most Mysterious Star Is Dimming - Sky & Telescope
download your stargazing ebook from sky telescope tabby s star otherwise known as kic 8462852 is dimming drastically in brightness giving astronomers an opportunity to figure out what has been causing this star s weird behavior update june 19 2017 and the dimming has begun again starting on june 11th the star began a slow decline dipping by about 1 keep up with the latest happenings at wherestheflux com update may 22 2017 updated brightness measurements show that the dimming event has ended the star appears to be back at its normal brightness but the monitoring isn t over yet and the next few days will tell if the star dips again update may 21 2017 the las cumbres observatory plot shown below has been updated to reflect the latest data ever since the kepler space telescope captured a series of random seeming dips from a certain mysterious star designated kic 8462852 astronomers and the public alike have been baffled by its behavior then following the end of the main kepler mission the star went quiet now at long last the star has begun a steep decline in brightness it s already 2 dimmer after a single night of observation and telescopes all over the world are at the ready for the first time astronomers are catching tabby s star in the act and that means the mystery of what causes the star to dip and dim in brightness may soon be solved nasa jpl caltechwhat is now famously known as tabby s star is a normal looking f class star in the field of the kepler space telescope kepler s mission was to monitor more than 150 000 stars watching for the minute dips in brightness that would signal an exoplanet moving across the face of its parent star from earth s perspective but in tabby s star kepler and the watchful eyes of citizen scientists involved in the planet hunters project found something completely different tabby s star was observed to dim 10 times sometimes by 1 typical of a giant exoplanet transit and sometimes by 10 to 20 not at all typical of exoplanet transits or anything else for that matter each dimming lasting days to weeks at a time the dips were irregular both in terms of how long they were and when they occurred the top panel shows four years of kepler observations of the 12th magnitude star kic 8462852 in cygnus several sporadic dips in its light output normalized to 100 hint that something is partially blocking its light the portion highlighted in yellow is shown at three different scales along the bottom the random irregular shape of each dip could not be caused by a transiting exoplanet t boyajian others mnrasthings became even more complicated when a longer term behavior was discovered tabby s star is fading away over the course of years and perhaps even centuries explanations for the star s behavior ranged from the mundane starspots to the interesting a comet breaking up around the star to the sci fi inspired a dyson sphere syphoning the star s energy for an alien civilization eventually various astronomers involved in the project including tabetha boyajian louisiana state university and jason wright penn state seemed to settle on two main explanations a circumstellar object of some sort such as a giant comet in an elliptical orbit or some dusty clump in the stuff between stars notably the comet scenario predicts a dimming event this very month from boyajian and colleagues paper published in january 2016 a more robust prediction is that future dimming events should occur roughly every 750 days with one in 2015 april and another in 2017 may read benjamin montet university of chicago and boyajian s article in the june 2017 issue of sky telescope for a full rundown of all the possible explanations there are clear ways to tell these scenarios apart but those ways require spectra during the dips and we don t have that kind of data from kepler for example if it s dust then the star will dim more at bluer wavelengths a dyson sphere on the other hand is presumably a solid object and so the star would dim the same at all wavelengths certain spectral fingerprints such as those left from sodium or calcium could also enable astronomers to learn more about the obstruction infrared data will also be key as any material close to the star ought to be hot and therefore ought to show up as excess infrared radiation so boyajian wright and several others made their predictions and settled in for a wait all they needed was for the star to stop pretending to be ordinary and sure enough tabby s star dropped its act on april 24th the robotic telescope at fairborn observatory spotted what might have been a dip in brightness or a statistical fluctuation the brightness returned to normal levels within a week nevertheless the event labeled event 1 in the light curve below caught astronomers attention and monitoring was increased then on may 18th a more significant drop began at 4 a m on may 19th boyajian called wright fairborn observatory in arizona had issued an alert that tabby s star had dimmed by 2 a big dip in the star s brightness the team immediately sent out the call for more observations this preliminary analysis of incoming data shows a possible initial dip labeled event 1 starting april 24gth which prompted additional monitoring on may 18th a significant dip began that prompted a full alert for followup observations tennessee state university center of excellence for information systems engineering and management fairborn observatoryalert tsboyajian s star is dippingthis is not a drill astro tweeps on telescopes in the next 48 hours spectra please  jason wright astro_wright may 19 2017as soon as the sun set around the world astronomers trained their telescopes on tabby s star from the amateur astronomers involved in the american association of variable star observers aavso to the spectroscopists at the keck i and ii telescopes in hawai i additional spectroscopy will come from the mmt observatory in arizona the las cumbres observatory global telescope network lcogt which was already regularly monitoring the star around the clock also stepped up its observing cadence the lcogt and fairborn observatory light curves are shown below for now it seems the dimming event has ended the las cumbres observatory global telescope network and fairborn observatory are continuing to monitor tabby s star this graph shows the brightness relative to the star s normal brightness the lowest point is a 2 drop in brightness updated data show that the star appears to have recovered from whatever caused it to dim accompanying spectra taken throughout the event will give clues as to what the cause is lcogt and tennessee state university center of excellence for information systems engineering and management fairborn observatoryeven space based telescopes slewed toward tabby s star while spitzer can t point in that direction of the sky the swift space telescope monitored the star s brightness at optical and ultraviolet wavelengths and this is far from an exhaustive list many more telescopes participated in follow up observations that in itself is no small feat considering that telescopes are typically scheduled weeks in advance  this is the first time we ve seen a clear dip since the kepler mission and also the first we ve caught in real time says wright the changes are as steep as we ever saw it change brightness with kepler  it s going to be a busy couple of weeks watch a live stream from earlier today with wright and seti director andrew siemion as they discuss the recent changes and incoming observations tags spc tabby s stari think that a word was left out of the first sentence ever since the kepler space telescope captured a series of random seeming dips typo fixed still tabby s star here at s t if the star had been discovered by a william boyajian would we call it billy s star at least the professionals have straightened up and are mostly calling it boyajian s star frank reedtabby herself calls it tabby s star i m sure she appreciates you trying to correct her on what is and isn t appropriate to name her star though if i could like comments i would like this 10000xnot a light curve but for those unfamiliar with it here s a diagram showing the location of tabby s star relative to the kepler image field and a picture i took of it last night http calgary rasc ca tabbys_star htmhey sounds like the simplest explanation for the random dimming is starspots giant megastructure around an entire star is comic book and would require too much work advanced civilizations would be basically lazy and never do that much work or require that much energy collection they would find a more intelligent and efficient solution you must be logged in to post a comment sky and telescope s beloved earth globe is now available in a
