Groklaw - A Brave New Modular World - Another MS Patent Application
groklaw gearcontact pjyou won t find me on facebookuser functionsno legal advicehere s groklaw s comments policy what s newsponsorsmicrosoft and modular are two words i wouldn t normally associate with one another so i thought maybe i d misunderstood it heaven only knows patent applications are generally written to confuse not illuminate and so i sent it to dr stupid to ask if he d please explain it to me he did and his explanation was so interesting i asked if i could share it with you as best as i can understand it it s not an attempted patent on a modular system per se that obviously wouldn t fly as he points out it s not new the patent relates to a method of delivery of an operating system where you start off with a very basic operating system a kind of crippled starter edition and then you pick and choose and purchase additional functionality with drm used to make sure you don t self help it s like modular copyleft turning the advantages of gnu linux modularity there increases what you can do and what you can add and how well everything works and instead turns the concept on its head by using modularity plus drm to restrict and contain and enforce the result seems a bit scary to me and i ask myself why would anyone agree to something like this perhaps i can chalk it up to microsoft innovating again they must be testing the outer limits of what a customer will put up with before bolting to linux certainly a valuable scientific study from my point of view so using our imagination let s extrapolate how could such a business model whether the patent is granted or not be used in an imagined microsoft brave new modular world of course microsoft doesn t need a patent to use this business model nor does a patent application prove it will use the model however as attorney michael geist phrases it microsoft s vista already seemingly wrestles control of the user experience from the user and this patent application brings to mind a model that takes it a further step another issue if microsoft doesn t need a patent to pursue this model then why apply for a patent to corner the market in restrictive controlling operating systems well speaking for myself microsoft can have that corner of the market to itself by all means when would having a patent on such a system be an advantage i ll leave all such possibilities to your imagination but here s how dr stupid understands the patent and how it could play out as a business model  introductionthe patent is not interesting for its technical content all the building blocks of the described system have been used for some time now but for the glimpse it offers into the business model envisaged by the applicant therefore i shall not delve into whether the patent should be granted at all in this discussion the application relates to a method of delivery of operating systems where one initially obtains a very basic operating system for example one that can do little more than display a web browser restricted to one site or domain and thereafter is presented with the option to select and purchase additional functionality some of the examples given echo aspects of the cut down starter editions of xp and vista 11 the operating system of claim 1 wherein the at least one add on module corresponds to a number of concurrent applications active at a time now having a simple starter system to which additional functionality is added and upgraded via software modules is not new this is the traditional installation approach used by debian and the idea goes back further than linux distributions themselves one could argue that it is part of the central unix philosophy for example what distinguishes the proposed system s approach is the following 1 retrograde steps in base functionality some of what is described as additional functionality is actually providing functionality which ought to be and previously has been standard in the operating system for example any modern general purpose operating system even a very basic one should support running as many simultaneous applications as the user wishes limited only by the constraints of the platform hardware to impose a limit of say 4 simultaneous applications is an arbitrary restriction more pointedly preparation of the artificially limited version requires further engineering effort there is no sweat of the brow argument i can see to differentially price the limited and unlimited versions in contrast a multi processor capable os kernel does represent additional engineering effort compared with a uniprocessor kernel and as such could be justifiably offered as a paid for upgrade this use of an explicitly defeatured system as one presumes a loss leader item which the producer hopes the user will pay to upgrade will be familiar to readers as demoware or more unkindly crippleware but to my knowledge this is the first time such an approach is being extended to encompass an operating system as opposed to a few low cost handy utilities the patent application amusingly tries to dress up the removal or impairment of functionality which currently all users enjoy as standard as a benefit the purchaser of a new computer might be entitled to expect to be able to plug in all his or her peripherals from the old computer so even if your modem line and isp support 8mbit s your internet browsing may be deliberately throttled by the os unless you obtain an additional module i would tentatively offer the suggestion that any user would want the os to use the full capacity of the hardware at all times even when performing simple tasks the placement of high speed access in a module implies that the standard offering might deliberately throttle back disk performance to create an artificial reason to upgrade 2 drm to control system expansiondrm in various forms is used a to ensure the new functionality has been legitimately obtained i e paid for and b to only allow approved additional modules 12 the operating system of claim 1 wherein the at least one add on module comprises digital rights management corresponding to at least one of a number of uses of the add on module an expiration date of the add on module or a cumulative uses of the add on module of these two aspects a can be defended as an anti piracy measure b on the other hand serves the main purpose of obstructing third parties from filling in the functionality holes in the basic offering themselves or to borrow a popular phrase removing the computer s owner s freedom to tinker there is a clear signal that the ability to install even non approved applications let alone os components is controlled since the ability to install non certified programs is placed in an add on module the natural question to ask is will the computer s owner have to pay a surcharge to install the software he or she wants on the hardware he or she owns 3 drm to selectively enable and disable functionalitywhile not spelled out in the application the fact is that the module s drm attributes are checked periodically and on every system start allow remote termination of access rights for reasons other than expiry of a subscription thus the entity administrating the digital rights framework the operating system publisher or an appointed 3rd party will be able to punish the user for actual or suspected transgressions of a eula by disabling the relevant functionality modularityall operating system vendors are moving toward a more incremental model of os delivery recent it press coverage of the vista release has had as one of its themes the widely held opinion that vista will be the last os of its kind a monolithically delivered package from microsoft here s but one example speaking generally there are undoubted benefits to both user and os provider in modularity from the users perspective modularity allows him or her to mix and match components choosing from several providers for each coarse functionality area unnecessary components can be disabled reducing system resource consumption and improving system security and reliability as previously mentioned this is not a new technology from the os provider s viewpoint modularity allows the os as a whole to be sold on a more flexible basis and arguably improves overall os quality by reducing unnecessary coupling between components there are areas however where what appears as a benefit to the end user is not a benefit to an os provider or at least one trying to maintain a monopoly market position by its very nature modularity eases replacement of system components other things being equal one would expect the market to naturally foster the appearance of 3rd party replacements for most if not all the os components the operation of the free market would also prevent artificial functionality restrictions ones where straightforward functionality is being turned off rather than new functionality being offered through genuine innovation from being viable as a business model for example if the basic window management component of an os only allowed for 8 top level windows then a 3rd party replacement component would soon appear which removed this restriction in the monolithic model of os delivery a provider with dominant market position can use the practice of bundling to undermine competitors if the basic installation of an os has component x pre installed to deliver functionality y this component enjoys an incumbency effect and thus reduces the likelihood of competing components w z being investigated let alone obtained and installed switching to a model whereby component x has to be actively chosen and possibly purchased by the user would on the face of it improve the opportunities for w or z to be chosen instead modularity real modularity militates against bundling in this context the ability of the core system to only allow approved os components to be installed appears to be a mechanism whereby the os provider can retain the benefits of modularity from its perspective while denying the end user his or her corresponding benefits at the very least 3rd party replacement components could expect to have to pay a de facto royalty to obtain and maintain their approved status the impact on foss licensed replacement components is obvious a possible scenarioso let us try to envisage what the total end user experience is likely to be in such a system some years in the future the owner of a new computer turns it on for the first time and is welcomed by let s call it blister basic edition this os has almost no functionality it can run a get connected to the internet wizard and then displays an online store in a simplified web browser the browser does not allow any other site to be visited although i refer to an online store the first transaction does involve more user expense he or she redeems a unique coupon code received as part of the purchase which allows him or her to install a number of additional modules compromises may have to be made perhaps the user does not have enough credit to have both enhanced i e normal disk performance and connect two printers the drm and certification features ensure that if the user wants additional or improved os functionality including security features these can only be obtained from the os vendor or a vendor approved 3rd party subsequently the blister update icon appears at regular intervals to offer the user new improved functionality the os updates are more frequent and less dramatic in this respect blister behaves more like linux or indeed to an extent mac osx these updates are unlikely to be free doubtless one will be able to purchase them on an as is basis but the pricing structure will be such that it seems much more compelling to buy say 3 year subscriptions one simple regular payment and the user can get all the upgrades he or she wants however the total payments spread over 3 years will probably be more than the original monolithic os price otherwise the os vendor would be making less money moreover the user could now be required to pay for bugfixes which traditionally have been free upgrades the application explicitly proposes this and with no little audacity claims it as an end user benefit requiring users to pay for security fixes of interest to them hardly seems the route to greater overall security on the internet rolling upgrades and upgrade treadmillsif blister is kept upgraded on a rolling basis like this then in one respect the user does benefit no more big bang upgrades rather like debian you only install it once from the os provider s view the rolling model as well as yielding a steady revenue stream has two market position benefits i it gets rid of the jumping off points upgrading from one major version of an os to another e g xp to vista is rarely a straightforward experience it is a situation where a vendor can lose customers either because they decide to change platform instead of upgrading or the upgrade trashes their system and they change loyalties as a result by removing the big bang of a platform upgrade there is no longer a natural point for the user to try any other os ii if a user pays for 3 year s upgrades in advance the sunk cost fallacy will deter him or her from switching os providers during that period of course as the 3 years approaches the end various tempting special renewal offers will be presented to him or her by blister update there is an obvious analogy with mobile phone contracts here iii because additional modules have to be certified the user cannot remove modules whose functionality is purely for the benefit of 3rd parties e g targeted advertising prevention of fair use of legitimately purchased content with whom the os vendor has a business relationship or agreement the ability or threat of remote disablement of functionality may also be relevant here conclusionall in all it fits with an overall goal of turning your home pc from an empowering tool into a don t tamper appliance indeed into a device that you effectively lease rather than own that is useful for little more than delivering approved partner content and taking part in those harmless online activities that don t endanger the os vendor s revenue or those of its approved partners a model where the level of functionality of the os can be purchased on so fine grained a basis has many other interesting and disquieting possibilities which cannot all be covered in this space since all functionality enhancements have to pass ultimately through the gatekeeper of the base os vendor this vendor gains a power of patronage for example a blogger who passed favourable comment on one of the os vendor s products could find himself rewarded with a free upgrade of a minor system component the scope for mischief by a unscrupulous os vendor is also vast not that i make any particular allegation here  reply to this  reply to this  reply to

free tcp ip hm problem you just gotta love open protocols  reply to this there s probably prior art for a long while ibm has shipped hardware with processors installed but disabled give your credit card number to your friendly salesman and the extra processors are turned on for you no engineer visit required once you know how to do that and figure that it represents a viable business model the rest is obvious  reply to this  some years in the future the owner of a new computer turns it on for the first time and is welcomed by let s call it blister basic edition this os has almost no functionality it can run a get connected to the internet wizard and then displays an online store in a simplified web browser the browser does not allow any other site to be visited manufacturers often include demos and crippleware for additional software in addition to a fully functioning operating system but i cannot see a computer manufacturer selling computers which have no functional capabilities out of the box so even if microsoft implements such a scheme for purchasing windows without hardware i would think that the computer manufactures would continue to sell pre configured operating systems with their hardware if microsoft were foolish enough to insist on distributing a crippled version of windows on new computers then the manufacturers would be forced to sell a full featured operating system with each new computer and also include the crippled version of windows as an optional operating system at the customer s choice  steve stites reply to this  reply to this  reply to this  reply to this this is more to do with any appliance bill gates has already said that current tv sets will be obsolete in a few years replaced no doubt by a microsoft device microsoft also have a strategy for the house of the future when you buy your future tv device you will have to pay to enable various modules just a few dollars per month and you will get extra channels showing films or sport or whatever you wantcars already have computers in them you want your car radio enabled just pay the monthly fee taken to extremes every appliance will be installed with basic functionality so your humble kitchen oven can have features enabled as long as you pay and if you want a similar feature to today s pc you can have your tv entertainment centre enabled to provide office facilities education stuff whateverindeed not a brave new world more 1984 double bad bad  reply to this  reply to this  reply to this  reply to this in this context i d say that there s nothing special that separates an operating system from a program or application an operating system is simply a subset of programs  powerful committed communication touching the jewel within each person and bringing it to life  reply to this  reply to this actually no linspire releases the security updates free of charge it s the remaining updates os updates etc that are pay to play clicky example to linspire reply to this  reply to this  reply to this  reply to this  drm as a solution it solves the wrong problem as a technology its logically infeasible  reply to this  reply to this  reply to this  reply to this are we sure this can t be applied to net installs of linux distributions on the face of this it seems as though an attempt could be made to use this against debian gentoo and other linux distros that initially install a restricted environment restricted because the useful stuff just plain ain t there and then download the rest and just what do they mean by a metered disk drive is m planning to charge you for access to your own hard disk the summary in the description seems to fit the typical gnu linux system quite well iirc this is exactly how most gnu linux systems are set up this is more or less what apt get yum and emerge do while packages are normally installed system wide on gnu linux it is possible to install programs in a user s home directory making the program available only to that user and just how is all this different from say gentoo or linuxfromscratch  freedom to tinker what the hell s that are you some kinda hippie so now you have to pay extra if you actually want to use however many gib of ram you paid for i lost track of anything resembling meaning in the fog of obfuscation that begins around detailed description of various embodiments  reply to this other than the threat from a bogus patent i wish they d do this i can t imagine too many people would put up with this for long once they twigged to the game they d switch en mass to something else so the implication is this only works if you can prevent linux from being a viable alternative  reply to this  reply to this  reply to this  reply to this  reply to this  reply to this  reply to this  reply to this  reply to this  reply to this in the detailed description of various embodiments in paragraph 0014 is it normal to reserve the meaning of the language of claims in a a patent the paren quoted clause acknowledges that they don t reserve the meaning of the claims the next portion claims they can as in the case of we reserve the right to find new meaning of our claims in the future this reminds me of president bush writing disclaimers on bills he signs into law in the claims a core function module a license validation module and nothing restricts the definition of operating system to a kernel this patent could be for purposes of threatening unsuspecting companies used to claim coverage of any licensing scheme for any organized software system  reply to this  reply to this  reply to this i can hardly imagine the mileage they will try to get out of that one  reply to this  reply to this  reply to this  reply to this  any technology distinguishable from magic is insufficiently advanced geek s corollary to clarke s law reply to this  reply to this see this yahoo news article obviously the technology described in patent is much more general e g it contemplates upgrading from the starter edition and it contemplates a much more general modular system but that s just how patents get written when you write a patent you need to consider not only what you re doing now but also all the things that you or your competitors might want to do in future and also all the ways that a competitor might get around the feature i suspect that writing a more complex patent also helps avoid prior art too ms can tell the patent office no registering shareware crippleware is not prior art because there s only one module but we have multiple modules  reply to this  reply to this one thought repeatedly bounced around my head while reading this they re not talking about a computer in the sense you re used to they re talking about your mobile phone your set top box your internet enabled fridge your plethora of other devices that some think shall soon rise to prominence but above all your phone  reply to this  reply to this in the late 80s or early 90s there was a us federal government specification for computer security if i recall correctly it was called the orange book it specified four classes of operating system security the lowest class d had little or no security the next level c had discretionary access controls the next level b had mandatory access controls the highest level a was provably secure within each class there were a number of certification levels the number of levels was different for each class a lower level number meant that the certification process had found fewer faults and no i do not remember the details one particular version of dec s vms achieved a c2 rating for a few years it was the only commercial operating system with that good a rating all the other commercial operating systems had lower ratings there was also a special version of vms with a b rating it was considered theoretically possible to get an a rating but you would need to design the operating system from scratch and be able to prove the software and hardware implemented the design specification properly to put it simply a class a rating was well beyond the state of the art at that point what makes the subject of this patent interesting is it has all the ear marks of a class a secure system one of the harder requirements of the class a systems was the absence of covert communication channels between processes with different security specifications two of the known covert channels were artificial variations in the computational load which could be detected by the amount of cpu time that was available to processes with other security parameters and variation in disk transfer requests which could be detected by other processes by timing the rate their own disk transfer requests took one of the few ways to close these covert channels was to deliberately limit the resources available to each process so that the delays became more uniform simply the os was carefully crippled and that crippling was part of the basic design much like what dr stupid said about the system in the patent the limits on trusted code are also significant requirements for the more secure security classification similarly assuring that response times could not exceed some bound and that the software meets proper certification tests makes such a system usable for safety critical applications all in all this looks more like something aimed at secure government and industrial systems than it looks like something a normal consumer would put up with there is a niche for this kind of operating system but it is not in the consumer sector  mtew reply to this  reply to this  reply to this  reply to this the us govt specifically the dept of defense and the state dept and mcdonnell douglas do have prior art on this in the 1980s they sold australia on the f 18 hornet fighter bomber as a dassault mirage replacement what they didn t say was that they would sell only what they wanted to sell as regards the radar and avionics which were not a complete set particularly not for australian conditions and of course australia could upgrade at mcdonnell douglas pleasure and the dod and state dept s pleasure not according to australia s necessities this concept that a company can do that sort of thing indeed has the right to do that sort of thing is hardly news of course the idea that one has the right to constantly redefine what one means by a product one has sold isn t that new either i believe most judges pass down severe sentences for such innovation and also that it is found defined mostly in the crimes acts of various countries it will definitely be a first to have it protected by patent  finagement the vampire s veins and pacific torturers stretching back through his own season well cutting
