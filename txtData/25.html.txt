session brawn s jenson button was second in hot conditions while team mate rubens barrichello topped the first session mclaren impressed in the morning though world champion lewis hamilton span out early on in the afternoon  i had a bit of a half spin in the high speed corner and damaged the wing said the 24 year old i didn t even really feel it but i did touch the wall and grazed the front but it could have been a lot worse  we made some changes this weekend and tried something new on my car and we don t have lots of wings available but if we go back to the old set up then we have spares so it won t be a problem  i think we ll still be good tomorrow so i m still positive it s just a shame we missed so much time but it can be regained practice timesheets are essentially irrelevant teams are largely testing cars and running different programmes for each of their two drivers in order to collect data they can analyse afterwards but mclaren for whom world champion hamilton won the last grand prix in hungary may be heartened that their recent progress appears to be continuing with their strong showing in the first session as heikki kovalainen and hamilton came second and third

came in fifth and eighth respectively in the first session with vettel reporting good balance through all corners back to his garage before tailing off in the second brawn driver button who has stressed the importance of resolving his car s issues this weekend reported understeer first and then oversteer on his modified car during the 90 minute morning session team boss ross brawn said that although the cars had a reasonable aero upgrade the cars improved pace was solely down to the hotter ambient temperatures in valencia the team have been uncompetitive in the last three races because they could not get their tyres up to the correct operating temperatures in the cooler conditions and brawn said the team had investigated the problem but had so far not come up with a way of solving it  tyre temperature is still an issue we will have to find a solution to brawn said our strength is our ability to use the tyres in hot weather we have to work out how to use them in cold temperatures he said the team had some ideas that they planned to try for the belgian grand prix in a week s time the spa francorchamps circuit is in the ardennes mountains and the race is often run in cool weather webber and vettel second and third placed in the driver s championship have closed the gap on leader button in recent weeks but the englishman still leads by 18 5 points renault and ferrari new boys romain grosjean and luca badoer ran relatively cautiously around the valencia street circuit badoer 38 is only driving for ferrari because german legend michael schumacher was not considered fit enough to replace the injured felipe massa a neck problem denying the seven time world champion a sensational return to the sport his italian stand in duly finished with the slowest time in the first session before finishing third last in the second as he got to grips with the formula 1 spotlight though he completed 62 laps over the course of the day more than a grand prix race
