said a spokesperson of shakti vahini an ngo based here even the death of a girl from jharkhand in dahola village of jind district recently failed to end the apathy of the administration said the spokesperson of shakti vahini according to shakti vahini while the social welfare department of the state was providing temporary shelter for the victims at the nari niketan in karnal the failure to devise clear cut policy had obstructed their permanent rehabilitation by failing to send them back to their parental villages in effect they have been languishing at the niketan and could again become a victim of the trafficking network the spokesperson added it was claimed that a survey by the ngo recently in districts of karnal jind kaithal and panipat had revealed large scale trafficking of women from jharkhand the spokesperson highlighted the murder of tripala a girl from jharkhand who had been married to one ajmer singh of dahola village in jind district on february 21 allegedly after refusing to go to bed with one of the elder brothers of her husband according to reports there were at least three girls from jharkhand who have been rescued and rehabilitated in the nari niketan however they have been waiting to be sent back to their parental houses according to the ngo though the police have registered a case of murder against ajmer singh there has been no mention of the trafficking of the woman in the whole episode according to sources the average profit from selling a girl from jharkhand ranged between rs 15 000 to 20 000 it is stated that one of the girls presently stationed at the nari niketan had been sold three to four times her father who had been involved in the racket has now sought her custody through the court even as the intervention of the social
