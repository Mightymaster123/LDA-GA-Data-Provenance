kak ramachandran tribune news servicenew delhi march 18 the cag has censured the delhi government s department of education doe for improper implementation of the computer education project in its second phase in its report for the year 2005 the cag points out that the doe has failed to implement a computer education project in accordance with the terms of the contract resulting in unfruitful expenditure of rs 87 55 lakh and non levy of penalty of rs 27 67 lakh despite a delay ranging between two and half to three months in the installation of computer systems in 54 schools by the firms to which the project was out sourced the education department failed to invoke the penalty clause of the contract and levy a penalty of rs 27 67 lakh incidentally the education department made the full payment to the firms amounting to rs 49 13 lakh even when there was no computer education being provided by them as per the contract drawn between the government and the private firms the installation testing and commissioning of the computers and accessories were to be completed within 20 days of the signing of the contract failing which a penalty at the rate of one per cent of the total contract value per week was be levied for a maximum period of four weeks and thereafter the contract would be terminated in 43 schools where the computers remained packed in boxes because there were no classroom to install them the firms were again paid rs 38 42 lakh a whopping loss to the exchequer was not the only casualty the delay in the implementation of computers led to 69 840 students being deprived of the benefits of the project for nearly a quarter of the academic year washing its hands off the blame the doe claimed that the delay in the preparation of computer labs was the responsibility of the public works department and that the quantum of penalties are still being finalised in the second phase of extending computers to 245 schools the government had awarded contract

march 18 the proposed nri city project of noida is being renamed as express city a proposal to this effect is being brought up in the noida authority s board meeting on march 20 the nri city in sectors 96 97 and 98 along the expressway has already become a centre of controversy as almost all political parties have been issuing statements about it questioning the logic behind this project a pil has reportedly been filed in the high court against it many influential people are known to have shown undue interest in the development of this project now the noida authority mandarins have chosen to revive the project since consigned to cold storage by giving it a new name the main idea to present the proposal with a new name is to dispel the doubts that only nris will be allotted plots flats in this sub city this gave an impression that it was to attract only the nris which was not true this could have discouraged the local citizens from buying property in this project hence it has been decided to change its name to express city for which a proposal is being brought up for the board s approval in the meeting on march 20 the original proposal for setting up an nri city was approved by the noida board in 2004 the rural journalists association had challenged its formation vide a pil in the high court the proposal has since become a web of controversies but if these controversies are not given any weight the proposed express city could prove to be a useful project an it hub and an institutional area around expressway which will have a land rate of rs 3 900 per sq mt fifty per cent of the total area of this projected city has been reserved for residential sectors 4 per cent commercial and 12 per cent for institutional purposes with 14 per cent land kept as open
