opening an old rail route which lies north of the current route to ensure against problems at dawlish  it thought it could engineer its way out of the threat nature knows better professor frank chamberstwsw said had the recommendation in that 2004 report been heeded the studies would already have been completed and a clear preferred diversionary route might now be available the passenger

economies of devon and cornwall twsw chairman professor frank chambers said as for network rail it has for long been in complete denial about the vulnerability of the dawlish sea wall to severe storm

community and tourists in the south west need assurance that the government and rail bosses will really now get a proper grip  the loss of income and earnings in south and west devon and in cornwall
