advertisementby choe sang hunjan 29 2009seoul south korea north korea unilaterally declared on friday that it was scrapping agreements it had signed with south korea to ease military tension on the divided korean peninsula the announcement followed a series of recent saber rattling gestures from north korea that officials and analysts in seoul have said were aimed at raising tension to gain attention from the new administration of president barack obama and to win concessions from president lee myung bak of south korea  all the agreed points concerning the issue of putting an end to the political and military confrontation between the north and the south will be nullified said a statement from the committee for the peaceful reunification of korea the north korean agency in charge of relations with south korea it said the accords to be nullified included a 1991 agreement on reconciliation and non aggression as well as north korea s promise contained in the agreement s appendix that it would honor the western sea border claimed by south korea north korea has flouted these agreements by developing nuclear weapons and sparking naval clashes on the disputed sea border in 1999 and 2002 after the 1999 clash it unilaterally redrew the sea border advertisementgovernment analysts in seoul scrambled on friday to figure out the north s intentions for one thing they said it remained unclear whether the north was also nullifying the agreements its supreme leader kim jong il signed with president lee s two predecessors in 2000 and 2007 during rare inter korean summits advertisementthose two agreements have been the basis of a decadelong softening of relations on the peninsula during the sunshine period billions of dollars of trade and economic aid as well as millions of south koreans on tour or for family reunions crossed the heavily armed border north korea has even called the oldest and primary agreement for peace the 1953 armistice that ended the three year korean war a useless piece of paper won tae jae a spokesman of the defense ministry in seoul said friday in a news briefing that the south would respond resolutely if north violated its western sea border again  we will see more tension in western waters said lee byong chul senior fellow at the institute for peace and cooperation a nonpartisan policy advisory body based in seoul it doesn t appear that it will just end up as empty words from the north he predicted that north korea would focus on improving ties with the obama administration while snubbing president lee driving a wedge between the allies has been a favorite tactic in north korean diplomacy the north korean committee said it was scrapping the agreements because mr lee had violated them first with his reckless confrontational rackets against our republic please verify you re not a robot by clicking the box invalid email address please re enter you must select a newsletter to subscribe to view all new york times newsletters  relations between the north and south have worsened to the point where there is no way or hope of correcting them the committee s statement said they have reached the extreme point where the clash of fire against fire steel against steel has become inevitable north korea s oratorical attacks on the south have increased in intensity since mr lee took office a year ago with a vow to take a tougher stance on north korea reversing 10 years of his liberal predecessors efforts to engage the north with substantial economic aid advertisementtwo weeks ago the north korean military declared an all out confrontational posture with the south north korean officials also told a visiting american scholar that the country had weaponized enough plutonium for four or five atomic bombs verbal threats from north korea which has at various points vowed to turn south korea into a sea of fire and a heap of ashes are a recurring feature of postwar relations between the two countries they seldom raise an alarm among south koreans since the 1970s the two koreas have signed a series of agreements for non aggression and cooperation which the north has flouted repeatedly rendering them little more than symbolic still this was the first time north korea has said that it was officially nullifying them  we hope the north will realize that spawning and raising tensions between south and north korea is not appropriate for peace not only on the korean peninsula but also in northeast asia and the rest of the world said kim ho nyeon the south korean government s main spokesman in inter korean relations mr kim said the government was dealing with the north korean blustering with calm but some analysts said that the chances of north korea launching a limited border skirmish to prove its points were rising still the south korean military heightened security along the border in the recent weeks so far it has reported no unusual movement by the north korean army we re interested in
