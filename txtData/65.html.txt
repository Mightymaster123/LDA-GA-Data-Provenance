Saturn's Great White Spot spring storm
new technologies have allowed astronomers to gather detailed observations of saturn s great white spot a raging storm the size of the earth that has tended to form in the planet s northern hemisphere every 30 or so earth years at its peak it was a huge white spot that circled the planet s surface with a long white tail streaming off it to the east writing in the journal nature two groups of researchers this week present information about this storm which began in the early part of saturn s spring or earth s december of 2010 the first paper describes initial signs of the storm being detected by ground based telescopes on dec 5 2010 as a barely visible bright point emerged on saturn the same day the radio plasma wave science instrument on board nasa s cassini orbiter spacecraft detected electrical activity linked to the storm as in previous great white spot storms only five of which have been documented in the past 130 years the spot grew rapidly both in size and brightness expanding from a length of 1 800 miles to 5 000 miles in just one week it took 55 days for its tail to encircled the planet it s believed that the white clouds that make the massive spring storm so visible are produced by plumes of warm moist air that bring ammonia ice particles to the planet s upper atmosphere the second paper measured the lightening discharges in saturn s atmosphere by looking at the radio waves they emit called saturn electrostatic discharges the researchers recorded peak flash rates of ten per second with intensities 10 000 times stronger than earth lightening such lightning storm can last for days to months on saturn you can hear the sounds of lightening detected by cassini on nasa s web page here visit science fair for your daily dose of scientific news from dinosaurs to distant galaxies science fair is written by science reporters dan vergano and elizabeth weise and weather reporter doyle rice their subjects are often controversial and always fascinating be they stem cell research slime mold or underground slush on mars more about the teamsubscribe to science fair via rsssign up for science fair e mail alertsdelivered by feedburner
