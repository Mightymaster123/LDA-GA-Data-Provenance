ambassador christian barros melet and u s ambassador samantha power who led the delegation said they were encouraged the pair commended martelly for his efforts in trying to break the impasse by reaching out to the opposition and promising to continue the dialogue to bring opponents demanding his resignation off the streets and to the negotiating table  we are very encouraged by the effort at consultations with the opposition with civil society that the president has made and out of this meeting even more encouraged by his determination to continue those consultations even after the lapsing of the parliament power said  the democratic contract between the government and the governed is a critical part of haiti s development and we on the u n security council want to offer haiti all of the support we can she said power said members were further encouraged by friday s installation of a new nine member provisional electoral council cep to organize the balloting it is the fifth since martelly s 2011 election and was sworn in just hours before the delegation touched down during the installation ceremony at the council s headquarters in petionville recently installed prime minister evans paul said the international community does not have to direct haitians to hold elections  we have to do it he said elections are indispensable for the stability of haiti as paul spoke across town thousands of anti government demonstrators took to the streets in the second day of consecutive protests demanding martelly s resignation and accusing him of foot dragging on elections and of trying to be a dictator  since martelly came to power everyone can see how he s violated the constitution said protester ronald fareau 46 carrying a mini haitian flag in his hands as he walked down a capital street he s had nine carnivals but not done one election and instead of defending us the people the international community is defending its own self interests protesters not only asked for martelly s departure but also that of the u n s nearly 7 000 peacekeeping force known as minustah the force is marking its 11th year in haiti where it is accused of introducing a deadly cholera outbreak that has killed more than 8 700 and sickened more than 720 000 earlier this month judge j paul oetken of u s district court in manhattan dismissed a lawsuit filed by human rights lawyers seeking compensation for thousands of cholera victims the judge ruled that the u n has legal immunity lawyers for the plaintiffs said they plan to appeal and this week joined human rights groups here and in the united states in urging the security council delegation to address the cholera crisis the u n has refused to take responsibility for allegedly introducing the disease in haiti through one of its battalions 10 months after the earthquake but last year on the eve of a visit to haiti u n secretary general ban ki moon told the miami herald that the global body has a moral responsibility to help haiti martelly reminded security council members of that responsibility asking them to help support haiti s national plan for cholera eradication martelly said haitians have the right to protest and while conditions can t always be beautiful he remains committed to reaching out to the opposition to help develop haiti he also said he was determined to hold free fair credible and transparent elections something council members welcomed  having one election keeps the parliament out for too long he said so i hope that in a first phase we can have one election for the legislative branch for its part the haitian government hopes that council members which include representatives of all 15 nations including nine ambassadors see that haiti remains peaceful despite the ongoing political turmoil and demonstrations paul in a miami herald interview friday said he and martelly plan to reiterate that we will do all possible for elections to happen in the country this year at the top of the delegation s agenda is also the future of the military mission which has been drawing down  we plan to talk with them about not disengaging this year so as not to further weaken the fragile security situation paul said we also want them to influence donors to respect the promises they gave haiti and to engage with haiti to support the country s budget on saturday council members will begin the day with a visit to a housing development where formerly homeless earthquake residents reside about 80 000 earthquake victims remain in tent cities soon after they will fly to cap ha tien
