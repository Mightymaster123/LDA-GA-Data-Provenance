team is good but they are not that good the mental block the psychological edge that mourinho played upon during the numerous childish exchanges asides and squabbles down the years has just been stripped away what better place what grander stage to do it than wembley a week ahead of the opening fixtures in the barclays premier league let battle commence click here to read the match report from wembley host commentatorwell what about that a brilliant goal the first trophy of the season and a wenger mourinho spat as well you can t ask for much more than that i m sure we ll be hearing plenty more about that but for now that s all from me thanks for joining and i m sure you ll be back next week when the season proper starts pure soap opera jose mourinho waits at the bottom of the steps to shake hands with every arsenal player a classy move a chance to congratulate arsene wenger who remember went straight down the tunnel at the end of the game no wenger the last down walks straight behind his opposite number who unperturbed walks down the tunnel that is a proper quality snub this may not be the biggest trophy in meaning it s quite large in size but you can see from the look on john terry s face he wanted it winners just hate watching their opponents pick up a trophy for the second time in as many attempts mikel arteta lifts the community shield the fourth trophy arsenal have picked up at this ground in the past year and a bit as mourinho said before the game and mertesacker conceded after this doesn t mean everything but a trophy is a trophy and winning is a habit they ll be pleased enough petr cech was a huge favourite amongst chelsea fans and still is for many of them and he has already built a rapport with his new supporters he celebrated with them at the end before going to his former team mates gesturing the no 33 his age and his new shirt number it s been a brilliant start for the big keeper a clean sheet and a trophy in his first game arsene wenger looks like a very relaxed man as he talks to the tv cameras has a weight been lifted off his shoulders with a first win over jose mourinho  i am like all these players we love to be as good as we can be we have a good spirit and i believe we look dangerous  it says absolutely nothing concedes per mertesacker as petr cech hugs john terry it s still pre season but it s a beginner and speaking of the big keeper this is what arsenal s captain of the day has to say about his new stopper so much experience gives us a huge boost before the season arsene wenger disappears straight down the tunnel seemingly without shaking hands with jose mourinho but he has beaten the portuguese manager for the first time that must be nice arsenal probably deserve their win chelsea were pretty poor and it s a second consecutive community shield for the gunners all the focus has been on the keeper at the other end but thibaut courtois has just about kept chelsea in this kieran gibbs wins the ball high up the pitch feeds cazorla and gets it back after a brilliant pass but the big belgian denies him one on one what a save really nasty challenge from gary cahill a scissor tackle on olivier giroud completely needless that jose mourinho stands hands on hips as cazorla lines up the free kick which hits the wall and is deflected out for a corner arsenal won t mind this the play is all down one end with victor moses playing as a right back and ivanovic up front a game of pinball in the arsenal box but mertesacker isn t going to lose too many battles in the air at least not legally he is fouled and arsenal calm it all down four minutes of stoppages it s all kicking off here and were this a league game coquelin would surely be off a regulation foul sparks a semi brawl and falcao and coquelin push and shove each other the referee has to charge in to separate them which is unusual for a game like this but it simmers down quickly enough from the free kick ivanovic heads wide he was offside anyway how has this stayed out giroud holds the ball up arsenal break at pace ramsey charges forward picks out cazorla but his shot is as tame as they come straight at courtois when one on one but the ball breaks for ramsey on the edge of the box and his shot is deflected off matic inches wide no idea how that missed keeper well beaten branislav ivanovic really lets his keeper down with a shocking backpass which courtois can t control gifting arsenal a corner and despite only committing three men forward it s quite dangerous giroud sniffing around for a knockdown chelsea clear though and the focus returns to the other end of the pitch a couple of really poor clearances from bellerin allow chelsea to keep the pressure on and it results in a chance as oscar flicks a header towards falcao the former manchester united striker dives at the ball makes contact with his head and it goes away from the goal not easy but that was poor a couple of substitutions as ozil and terry are replaced by gibbs and moses eden hazard has contributed next to nothing so far today but when he gets on the ball he wins a free kick in a dangerous position wins may be the operative word i m not sure the contact justified his loud scream and dramatic fall not that it wasn t a foul mind the delivery is poor though and chelsea only have 10 minutes to find a way through what has been a fairly organised red defence this is what arsenal have missed since gilberto silva left the club coquelin goes into a 50 50 with willian and you are just in no doubt who is going to come out with the ball the arsenal man plays it away and returns to patrolling in front of the back four alex oxlade chamberlain is about to go off with mikel arteta replacing him but not before he works thibaut courtois from the edge of the box easy enough for the big belgian though chelsea beginning to tick and to the dismay of the arsenal fans it s all coming through cesc fabregas he takes advantage of an ozil mistake to drive at the gunners defence wins a free kick takes it quickly and almost gets in behind after playing a one two boos ring out from the gunners supporters kurt zouma then tests cech with a header but the arsenal keeper holds it well chelsea have shown more in the opening minutes of the second half than they did in the entire first period the passing is much crisper and with purpose it could be a long final 20 minutes for the gunners what a chance down the other end after cech clears the corner with a clattering punch arsenal break giroud feeds ozil and then when the ball comes in the big frenchman as he so often does gets there first over the bar though that could easily have been a second for arsenal who look so good on the break kurt zouma is on for chelsea amongst all that not quite sure how he ll fit in replacing azpilicueta oscar curls it over the wall and cech dives to push it round the post looked very good that but you d expect him to make it francis coquelin is the next man into the book he s been walking a tightrope for some time and a foul on the edge of the box earns him a deserved card it s a dangerous place for a free kick with oscar over the ball what play this is from arsenal s two right sided players hector bellerin stretches brilliantly to head away a cross oxlade chamberlain picks up the pieces and just runs he tears past azpilicueta nips the ball past matic before the spanish full back gets back to bring him down he is rightly booked giroud then goes close to scoring with his first touch arriving at the back post but firing over on the stretch a nice passage of play from arsenal comes to an end when aaron ramsey crosses to no one he still looks unused to the idea of olivier giroud not being in the box he won t have long to wait though because the french striker is being readied he comes on for walcottthis is shocking last season s player of the year produces an early contender for miss of the season cesc fabregas opens up his former club s defence with a lovely slid ball to find hazard in the box just to the right of centre the belgian through one on one slips as he shoots skying the ball miles over shocking miss should have been 1 1 radamel falcao that was a real chance a ball in behind finds the colombian who might have just been offside but wasn t flagged he brings it down but the first touch isn t quite good enough and koscielny gets back to nudge him aside chelsea s players must really like petr cech because thus far they seem determined not to cause him any bother at all the two most difficult things he has had to do so far have come from the boot of his own team mates including this looping failed clearance from monreal which he comes to claim oscar then shoots from 30 yards scuffed all along the floor and well wide can radamel falcao rediscover his goalscoring form so much was expected of him last season when he flopped spectacularly at old trafford will he bounce back brazilian international oscar who missed this summer s copa america through injury and has been constantly linked with a move away from stamford bridge is coming on and it s his compatriot ramires who goes off falcao meanwhile takes over from remy in the get caught miles offside game i think we ll see a lot of this in the second half at least until there is another goal chelsea with a lot of the ball arsenal looking to spring counters ozil and cazorla link brilliantly in front of the chelsea defence but the ball through for walcott doesn t quite come off coquelin then almost puts ozil in behind slightly too heavy with the pass otherwise the german was in it will be interesting to see how much they play this way but arsenal look seriously dangerous on the break there is so much pace in this side and oxlade chamberlain epitomises that he runs past azpilicueta but with walcott offside matic can come across to snuff out the attack at the other end falcao tries a first shot but it s blocked a rather sedate start to the second period in stark contrast to the first half chelsea eventually put together the first attack taking advantage of a terrible theo walcott pass and setting willian free down the right cech does really well to claim the cross low down the change we thought was coming and here it is falcao on for his chelsea debut replacing the shockingly poor loic remy will this be the falcao of manchester united or the man we knew before alex oxlade chamberlain has been reasonably quiet but when it mattered he came to the party a good move that saw cazorla pass to ozil to walcott and then to the ox loic remy on the other hand has been noticeable mostly for being offside check out more with our brilliant match zone so what do we think neither side has been brilliant but arsenal have certainly shown more cutting edge chelsea have not mustered a single shot on target despite edging position plenty of you mentioning in the comments however that the worst team so far have been the commentary team harsh but michael owen is annoying some people it s fair to say  according to michael owen mark chamberlain has a very proud look on his face pic twitter com ueeransrbfjose mourinho tries to leave early as the first period winds down but has to turn around as the crowd get all excited by a hector bellerin break the cross is dealt with though and the half time whistle sounds the gunners lead the champions at the break cech has made another save and this is on target but it s not from a chelsea player does that count a whipped free kick deflects of per mertascker and into his keeper s waiting arms eden hazard has been very quiet so far but we know he can click into gear at any moment a pass through finds remy but surprise surprise he s offside if the french striker isn t replaced it s a real indication of where radamel falcao stands petr cech has touched the ball this is not a drill petr cech has touched the ball ok that might be an exaggeration he s kicked the ball a couple of times but he has it in his hands for the first time as cesc fabregas gets a cross all wrong arsenal break quickly and they should score but oxlade chamberlain s touch is too heavy when they have four men forward he still manages to cross but it s a dinked effort and ivanovic clears even as he is fouled santi cazorla vs nemanja matic is fun to watch the tiny spaniard dances around the toes of the giant serbian like a puppy annoying a grizzly bear and then pulls off a sensational backheel to leave matic scratching his head cazorla is beginning to dictate things a little a delicious volley opening up some space before a cross makes chelsea s defence look uncharacteristically disorganised aaron ramsey who has a good record at wembley in terms of goalscoring tries his luck from a tight angle but hits the side netting what a chance this is loic remy finally does something and it s pretty good getting in down the left wing and crossing perfectly for ramires the brazilian midfielder meets it six yards out unmarked but blazes the header over a sitter mourinho looks furious this is an abject chelsea display so far they ve offered little going forward and the less said about loic remy s display the better not the way to make an impression on your manager theo walcott isn t a centre forward so we keep being told but he did really well in the build up to the goal and he s on the run again here he bursts past a defender on the break but then with three breaking alongside him the pass is poor aaron ramsey salvages the situation but by the time it reaches oxlade chamberlain azpilicueta is back at the other end chelsea have improved though not so much that they ve managed a shot on target yet hazard and remy combine nicely but the frenchman can t return it to his belgian team mate in the box willian tries a cut back but it s intercepted and then ramires curls one wide from 25 yards betterloic remy is about as useful so far as a boat with a hole in it he s offside yet again with no need at all mesut ozil on the other hand is just beginning to tick picking the ball up deep driving forward and almost finding walcott with a dainty chip into the box well defended though he s barely been involved so far but this is a brilliant goal from the ox walcott drops deep and feeds the ball right to his england team mate who cuts inside past azpilicueta and smashes it left footed into the top corner super strike this is a bit funny even if it hurts ivanovic runs his studs down cazorla s calf and the little spaniard s cry of ow is clearly audible not a nice tackle for a game like this to be honest but arsenal almost punish ivanovic with walcott heading the free kick powerfully at goal that s the first shot on target but comfortable for courtois loic remy is caught offside for about the 19th time already before walcott runs at and past ivanovic he goes down in the box but not much of an appeal branislav ivanovic has just shot from 70 yards when cech was on his line it didn t go anywhere near poor i can only guess that he had a bet on with his former team mate ramires chops down ozil again this time a free kick is given this is scrappy stuff this is better from arsenal as mesut ozil gets on the ball in a dangerous position for the first time and picks his way through the chelsea defence really lovely passage of passing football this but it breaks down and francis coquelin scythes down cesc fabregas to stop a break that s a booking in normal season ozil was clattered by ramires seconds earlier no foul given gary cahill is also down he slid in hard a few moments ago to stop nacho monreal bursting from left back and clattered his own man willian blood coming from the nose arsenal have not quite found their rhythm here neither side has had a shot on target but the gunners can t really get hold of the ball when they have some possession ramsey passes it straight out of play wasteful santi cazorla starting wide left is an interesting move by wenger he ended last season as the club s leading central midfielder wenger said as much in one of his press conferences aaron ramsey is playing alongside francis coquelin today a sign of things to come perhaps there s a clear pattern emerging in chelsea s play building up on the right before switching it quickly to the left wing and finding space to run at bellerin azpilicueta the latest man to have a go at the full back chelsea dominating so far for the first time chelsea open up arsenal and it s all down to willian he nicks past nacho monreal cuts into midfield and plays in loic remy great play bellerin blocks the cross and the corner comes to nothing jose mourinho is up off the bench to remonstrate with the officials but anthony taylor isn t interested fabregas got the ball first the big german defender didn t and brought him down that s a spot kick for me this is a bit scrappy willian loses the ball to coquelin in a really dangerous position but the brazilian to his credit wins the ball back the ball then ricochets off the referee who in a seeming fit of panic awards chelsea a free kick no hint of a foul there really moments later cesc fabregas is clattered in the box by per mertesacker surely that s a pen nothing given a very fluid formation for arsenal with pint sized genius santi cazorla looking to drift into space he almost creates some space inside the chelsea box before taking nasty stamp on the ankle from ramires nothing given thought chelsea seem to be targeting hector bellerin early on but the young spaniard does well to snuff out an attack in the right full back position after that early sacre chelsea have assumed an early measure of control loic remy is caught offside looking to get in behind before the frenchman looks to force a mistake out of hector bellerin the champions on top so far what a start theo walcott pinches the ball off nemanja matic straight from the kick off and arsenal break alex oxlade chamberlain crosses but courtois punches away blistering arsenal captain per mertesacker has turned the teams around at the toss meaning petr cech has to run towards the chelsea fans a few boos before the majority respond with wringing applause petr cech refuses to shake hands with a single former team mate don t worry he gave them all a fistbump instead looked a bit weird though i have to say kick off just a moment away red carpets introductions handshakes and jose mourinho in a t shirt it s all kicking off time for the national anthem 0 arsenal have not scored a goal against a jose mourinho chelsea side since 2007 gilberto silva 06 05 07 drought the players are out on the pitch and we are almost ready to go communityshield https t co efytskfstgok that s my last cech pun of the day probably no promises but the big goalkeeper is in the tunnel ready to be led out by his manager for a first competitive game as an arsenal player a few handshakes in the tunnel but he s not making any friends today out they come jose mourinho says he is keen to win today and pick up a trophy but he doesn t believe it will have any impact on the rest of the season  i don t think it has a relation with the official season mourinho has just told bt sport today is a trophy a little one but a trophy he also revealed that diego costa could be out of next weekend s season opener against swansea  i don t know if costa will be fit for the opening day of the league season we thought he could be ready but suddenly this morning he was not comfortable   i have difficult decisions to make but that s my job says arsene wenger when he is asked about the depth in his arsenal squad despite the absence of the injured danny welbeck and alexis sanchez still being given time off after the copa america wenger has an embarrassment of riches in midfield aaron ramsey looks set to start on the left wing today although he mesut ozil and santi cazorla could all interchange while jack wilshere was due to start today posing the question who can arsene leave out chelsea meanwhile may have a strong first team but the depth is more in question only oscar of their bench is an obvious starting level player for my money it s always difficult to read too much from pre season but on the evidence of the last few weeks arsenal are bang in form wins over everton lyon and wolfsburg have seen them lift two pre season trophies the goals have been flowing and young stars emerging chelsea have been less impressive but then again they have faced a higher calibre of opposition can they raise their game today time for a warm up arsenal players emerge from the wembley tunnel to prepare for afcvcfc pic twitter com zbmalcyzirthe absence from the two starting line ups of diego costa and olivier giroud presents a chance for two men with points to prove loic remy played very little last season after joining from qpr but has been preferred up front for chelsea to new signing radamel falcao theo walcott meanwhile is desperate to prove himself as a central striker and impressed in last season s cup final these two who rely more on pace than the power of their sides usual first choices will be keen to get on the scoresheet today the community shield s primary purpose may be to get everyone excited for the new season but today it also offers arsene wenger a chance to do something he s never managed before beat jose mourinho the frenchman might claim it doesn t matter much to him but he needs to get one over the portuguese nemesis soon because jose isn t going anywhere 1 the fa cup winners have won only one of the last five community shield matches though this was arsenal in last year s game curtains it s confirmed then petr cech for so long chelsea s no 1 will make his arsenal competitive debut against them sportsmail spoke to goalkeeping legend pat jennings about the czech international and his former team mate thibaut courtois read it here and then make up your mind which would you rather have in your team so despite assurances that he was fit just a few days ago jose mourinho confirms that diego costa is injured a really bad sign for chelsea they need their leading forward fit if they re going to retain the title this season you d think diego costa absent today due to discomfort in his hamstring says jose mourinho cfc communityshieldso what do you make of that the key points theo walcott starts as centre forward for arsenal loic remy selected ahead of diego costa for chelsea petr cech starts his first competitive game for arsenal against his former clubchelsea team courtois
