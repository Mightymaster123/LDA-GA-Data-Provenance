wednesday december 13 2006 tim johnson a united states democratic senator from south dakota reportedly suffered a stroke at about 11 30 this morning however subsequent tests revealed that the senator did not suffer a stroke or a heart attack he was transported to george washington university hospital by ambulance where he was diagnosed with a congenital arteriovenous malformation and underwent brain surgery he is currently recovering without complications and appropriately responsive to both word and touch but it still in critical condition and being monitored additional surgery may be required currently the us senate is controlled by the republican party however when the senate reconvenes after the recent midterm elections the democrats will have a one senator majority under the 17th amendment to the u s constitution state legislatures can give their governor the power to appoint someone else to take over but this power can only be used in cases where the senator vacates his seat historically this applies to death or resignation but serious illness does not count should johnson die or resign the republican governor mike rounds will likely appoint a republican in johnson s place this would bring the senate to a 50 50 tie for organizational purposes and give vice president dick cheney the tie breaking vote thus letting the republicans control the senate this appointment would last until the end of johnson s term in 2008 if he does not recover the senate has the power to force him out but historically the senate has not done so on nov 23 1969 gop sen karl mundt of south dakota who previously held johnson s seat had a debilitating stroke he later endured months of speech and physical therapy at his washington home mundt s wife mary refused to vacate the seat despite pressure from the state s republicans mund remained formally in his seat until his term expired in 1973 1 in the past multiple other senators have become incapacitated for months or even years and kept their seat 2 but party control of the senate was not involved  3 share this this page is archived and is no longer publicly editable got a correction add the template editprotected to the talk page along with your corrections and it will be brought to the attention of the administrators please note that due to our archival policy we will not alter or update the content of articles that are archived but will only accept requests to make grammatical and formatting corrections note that some listed sources or external links may no longer be available online due to age got a correction add the template editprotected to the talk page along with your corrections and it will be brought to the attention of the administrators please note that due to our archival policy we will not alter or update the content of articles that are archived but will only accept requests to make grammatical and formatting corrections
