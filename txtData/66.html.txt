the pbs reading show reading rainbow starring star trek the next generation and roots alum levar burton ends its 26 year run on friday its longevity was the third longest for a public television children s show beaten only by sesame street and mister rogers neighborhood  as a young child in the 80s the eye fondly recalls watching all three programs every weekday before switching over to the price is right later in the morning but we digress a friday morning npr report noted the show s conclusion and aired comments by john grant director of content at the show s home station wned in buffalo producers were unable to secure the several hundreds of thousands of dollars needed to renew the show s broadcast rights grant said why according to npr in the report a pbs official acknowledged the shift in reading philosophy from how do we get kids interested to a focus on phonics a spokesman for the education department did not return a request for comment or clarification if and when an answer arrives we ll post it here in the meantime take a trip down memory lane and sing along with the show s theme song oh and leave your thoughts in the comments section below read the follow up item here by ed o keefe august 28 2009 2 18 pm et categories agencies and departments save share previous eye opener aug 28 2009 next postal service plans to update its closure listthis is a deplorable development while teaching kids how to read is important teaching kids to love to read is even more important i m the daughter of the manager of one of fairfax county s public libraries and i watched reading rainbow every day as a kid if you don t teach kids to love to read teaching them how to read will not be enough too many americans these days know how to read but claim not to like reading instead they melt their brains on television and video games posted by esajudita august 28 2009 2 38 pm report abusewhat a terrible shame this has to be the favorite tv show in our house right now reading rainbow is one of the few educational shows on tv that works for kids reading or not who are getting too grown up for preschool shows but aren t yet ready to understand the storylines of the shows meant to appeal to tweens the other reason reading rainbow is a gem is that it s about the real world they go meet the people who run the trains who study the animals the kids who perform on stage the people who make special effects it s about how the world actually works we need more educational tv like that in fact while i think dragon tales wonderpets etc are all wonderful shows and even the insufferable to grownups dora and diego teach spanish they are all set in magical makebelieve worlds other than caillou and now sid the science kid are there any children s tv shows about the real world and how it works where there are no magical talking creatures or magical powers understand i am not against all this makebelieve but shows like reading rainbow i believe are an important balance and teach kids more about the grownup world in this vein does anyone remember the show big blue marble from my childhood it s theme song is so full of 70s optimism it is almost funny now but it was basically a 1 2 an hour documentary where they followed the life of a child in a different city or country around the world my children would love it just as much if it was on now anyway we will all miss reading rainbow posted by ljcboston august 28 2009 3 00 pm report abusesure it worked so what choice was there but to cancel it posted by jckdoors august 28 2009 3 13 pm report abusei m sorry that this show has been canceled i wholeheartedly agree with the first poster knowing how to read is worthless if a person doesn t want to read research shows fewer and fewer young americans are reading for pleasure researchers have charted the rise of aliteracy for more than a decade check out this article aliteracy among college students why don t they read ed410527 from the education resource information center s site in fact the neh sounded an alarm about 5 years ago canceling a show like reading rainbow seem ill advised but maybe reading isn t as important as we like to think

babies and toddlers it s a continuing trend posted by hesaid august 28 2009 3 24 pm report abusein one of my work areas science education we ve had similar trouble with the shift in focus science education does not formally teach children how to read and so resources and instructional time were reduced under nclb completely overlooking the notion that reading is a communication activity and students will benefit from using it to actually communicate gaining both the content knowledge and the expertise in understanding the communication reading rainbow suffers a double whammy it s not only not teaching children how to read it s about fiction heavens why should we waste precious resources on things that aren t true irony abounds posted by sciencetim august 28 2009 3 26 pm report abuselearning to love to read is so important the same goes for enjoying learning for its own sake i ve heard colin powell advise that finding good professors who are passionate about what they re teaching is as important as the subject matter chalk it up to the fallout from a long stretch of bad decisions at the top posted by loved1 august 28 2009 3 27 pm report abuseoh no the end of reading rainbow broadcasts on pbs i was so appalled at this news that i started my first ever petition on the care2 website asking pbs to continue distributing the program if you would be willing to sign

august 28 2009 3 36 pm report abuseteach a child to love reading and you will have a strong reader this new philosophy is a shame and a sham i loved this show as a child and am sad to see it go just as i have a new son who could have watched it and loved it as i did i hope that i can do a good job teaching him how much fun reading is lord knows the schools aren t going to as long as current policies remain in place posted by ppc5n august 28 2009 3 38 pm report abusei m not so sure a desire to emphasize learning to read is necessarily a bad decision at the top however reading is not a simple endeavor and preparing children to skillfully master all the many and varied skills and tasks required of highly competent readers who are also able to skillfully comprehend a variety of genres and texts goes far beyond spelling and phonics losing the reading rainbow is a sad thing for sure since the love of reading and the desire to engage in the story is what this show did so well this show more than many others helped the viewer make connections with the stories this is a significant literary thinking skill foundational to all learning endeavors regardless of the discipline after all isn t this what educated people do we make connections with what we read write and learn not just in the language arts but in all content areas and through all of life s endeavors i somehow feel we are being shortchanged here as a viewing public does anyone else feel this way posted by thewildmind august 28 2009 3 44 pm report abusepbs you guys have have just left another bunch of kids behind just like learning you have to find the joy in it reading rainbow was the perfect vehicle to teach kids how to enjoy learning reading and developing their imagination into a working reality it is more than phonics it s the stories stupid posted by cymp65 august 28 2009 3 45 pm report abusei have two children who loved this program however if there s such a demand for the show from parents and their children then some commercial entity should pick it up that s our system posted by c_e_daniel august 28 2009 3 46 pm report abuseit s bad enough that sesame street has been dumbed down to the point of imbecility and shows like the magic school bus are now on discovery kids which around here we can t get unless we pay the extra money for digital cable and mr rogers isn t shown on pbs anymore but now they re canceling reading rainbow too there is very little educational television on that is also fun anymore and that s just wrong what has this country come to where people have no problem shelling out money for celeb sleaze so called reality shows and family shows that are tacky rude and show no manners or morals whatsoever yet quality educational television for all children is being yanked because of lack of funding there are times i seriously entertain the idea of canceling our cable service altogether and going solely with shows on vhs or dvd because that s the only place you can find them anymore pbs i m very disappointed in your switches posted by dragondancer1814 august 28 2009 3 54 pm report abuseremember this is the same bush administration that censored a segment with two

and shame on everyone who voted for bush the love of reading is what got me doing it again i loved it as a kid grew tired of it after college because i did too much of it and now i read again for fun

library to look for the book that had been featured favorite books were usually found with great excitement under the christmas tree and were read over and over again and we still have them posted by belladonna0425 august 28 2009 4 26 pm report abusei spent 34 years as an elementary school librarian for 24 years of that reading rainbow was one of the best educational tools at our mine and the teaching staff disposal to connect reading with real world events and concepts which is a primary reason that being able to read is so important it connects us over time and distance in a way that allows time for thoughtful reflection the loss of reading rainbow is a grievous one to our nation i m going to the president on this one posted by jmla august 28 2009 4 26 pm report abusesorry to see it go but if this means more money to programs teaching kids how to read fine as far as reading rainbow teaching kids why to read that is something parents and teachers should be doing posted by bitter_bill august 28 2009 4 37 pm report abusemy children loved reading rainbow i believe that it was one of the best shows on television children read because they hear stories read to them and want to do it for themselves spelling and phonics can only go so far it is a love of reading that really makes the difference and that is what reading rainbow was all about posted by evelynsaenz august 28 2009 4 49 pm report abuselearning to read is about loving words studies have proven that the success of a child s educational career starts with having a rich vocabulary by the age of 3 someone remind bitter_bill where his love of the written word came from if there is any proof of where the value of education is on a slippery slope you re experiencing it right now my love of reading came from watching my mother retire to her bedroom and closing the door to read being a loner by nature i imagined traveled and lost myself in books all kinds of books my nephew has visited me for the past 5 years and always knew that reading rainbow came on before we left for church reading rainbow was not a failure not on any level posted by mukazzi august 28 2009 4 56 pm report abuseit is just as important that kids learn to love reading one of the most important things this show did was create the desire to learn to read before the skills can be taught children need to learn to love reading and make it something they want to do posted by tigger11566 august 28 2009 5 05 pm report abuseall the comments here are right on point teaching how to read is just the first small step in a much larger process of learning it is a love and appreciation of reading that truly inspires children to move on and do great things of all the pbs shows reading rainbow probably was my children s favorite perhaps next to wishbone for my son my daughter graduated from st john s college in annapolis a school which employs the great books program with a bachelor s degree she went on to graduate from cua law school with a jd degree my son currently is enrolled at vanderbilt university in nashville as an undergraduate both were adamant fans of reading rainbow and both have had since they were old enough to read a passion for books and reading at christmas or on my birthday what gifts do i receive from my children books because my children appreciate them as timeless and invaluable gifts i suppose as the saying goes all good things must come to an end and i suppose reading rainbow is no exception however if the reasons are as stated in this article then that is truly unfortunate and is yet another example of the dumbing down of pbs children s programming you can teach phonics and basic reading skills until you are blue in the face but unless you provide avenues that instill a love of learning and exploration through books i submit you haven t really accomplished much anyone can teach a parrot to speak it is quite another thing to engage them in intelligent conversation my

bastardized it by writing in a contrived plot i learned to read before i knew that you had to learn to read i just watched easy reader and two faces in silhouette say p lease please over and over kids tv is completely ruined posted by auntiemare august 28 2009 5 57 pm report abusei m sorry they ll stop producing reading rainbow and hope that our pbs station will keep showing reruns there is so much new programming these days much of it good but the emphasis on phonics and words and spelling is getting very repetitive basically most of the shows are now orienting themselves around the exact same themes of phonics language there is little narrative to be found i think reading rainbow adds a now much needed element of imagination and exploration to the pbs kids lineup let s all write our pbs stations and make our voices heard posted by kedohio august 28 2009 6 02 pm report abusethe philosophy of reading rainbow is the reason i have at least two hundred books in my collection and growing i use to rush home to watch the show when i was a child in and i remember the book recommendations were the first i would look for when my parents took me to he library and that was the point i knew how to read from school but i sure as heck didn t red the ny times to get my recommendations posted by bainst august 28 2009 6 39 pm report abuseooh i loved that show so sad posted by rlj1 august 28 2009

what goes on behind the scenes of filming of a tv show or the saguro cactus plant of arizona the only good thing is that my county library system is starting to get reading rainbow dvds in the system for checkout posted by startrekvoyager015 august 28 2009 6 57 pm report abusewhat s the use of our children knowing the mechanics of reading if they don t want to read a strong desire to read is the best way to learn and improve one s skil at reading this is a step backwards as far as i can see posted by calgirl1 august 28 2009 7 03 pm report abusei am so upset that this show will not continue reading rainbow was so important to me when i was a child i gained an enjoyment for reading good literature from the show i watched this show every day from the time i was born until i graduated high school lol reading rainbow did not try to focus on phonemic awareness or prereading skills it simply taught kids that reading could be fun and that reading could teach you about different things and that you can do anything if you use your imagination i am a preschool teacher and former reading rainbow watcher and am deeply saddened that kids will no longer be able to enjoy this program posted by herbyj_01 august 28 2009 7 05 pm report abusei am too old to have benefited from reading rainbow but i did watch sesame street with my younger brother and he picked up reading faster because of it i have friends who are beside themselves that their kids do not read willingly and thus read poorly for their age group i think that reading world is healthy bridge between green eggs and ham and harry potter perhaps funding will come from some organization that wants to help build knowledge industries of america for example apple or microsoft or perhaps one of the big oil companies that realize tomorrow s engineers and oil field staff have to be comfortable about reading as pres obama said yes we can ps i admit that my parents let my sister and me buy comic books with our allowance and that led to hardy boys and nancy drew books and that begat michener s books and both of us now read for enjoyment also we did not have a television at our cottage and instead went 2 3 times per week to the local library i believe it is important for kids to realize the enjoyment of the written word on the page coming alive while read on the bus or in a window seat on a cloudy november afternoon posted by beprudent august 28 2009 7 06 pm report abusewe all accept this so easily how can we let this happen reading rainbow makes it through the dark years of 2001 2009 only to be cancelled now is there nothing we can do to stop this posted by whoamireally august 28 2009 7 06 pm report abuseone problem in kids learning to read and learning why to read are the quality of books written when i was going age 5 up i lived at the library and i could check out any book i was not limited to the first grade books when i was in first grade i was reading books way above my grade level has anyone ever asked kids why they like to read the harry potter books but not much in the textbooks that should be an eye opener posted by palmspringsgirl august 28 2009 7 34 pm report abusereading rainbow was an awsome show i remember first watching it and then getting my parents to take me to the library so i could check out books it s a shame we live in society where a program like this is cancelled but we still have the real world posted by bmacattack august 28 2009 7 40 pm report abusereading rainbow was just a way for busy professionals to feel righteous about parking their kids in front of the boob tube while they wandered off to make a phone call to their stock broker or therapist posted by greg3 august 28 2009 8 13 pm report abuseit is a shame that we are going to lose one of the best children s shows on pbs its a crying shame that it is being pulled mr burton has been a welcome and long time friend to all of my children and we ve read many an excellent book together at his recommendation as for blaming the bush administration i ll remind my colleagues that nclb was written in conjuntion with and was endorsed wholeheartedly by none other than sen edward kennedy there s plenty of blame to go round posted by wvmama august 28 2009 9 45 pm report abusemum of a tot here we review children s shows to find the ones that we think are worthy of daughter s time because we have to keep her entertaiend while we make frequent calls to our stock broker and therapist see greg3 aug 28 8 13 pm so few are really worth it let me tell you phonics is really not that hard the vast majority of kids get how to sound out letters early on what is more difficult is learning how to interpret and talk about what you read how to find the story line how to describe what characters are feeling predictin what will happen next and so on i ve seen a number of the phonics shows shows about phonics are incredibly boring because mostly phonics is boring sesame street and electric company the old school versions worked on phonics and other language mechanics just often enough and with the right amount of wit but the real joy is in thinking about the stuff of books and stories sorry to hear rr is leaving i was too old for the show but my youngest sister now 30 loved it she s a pretty good reader and writer too posted by magoo1 august 28 2009 9 48 pm report abusereading is an important skill to be used in understanding written directives from superiors a love of reading is a subversive trait that may lead to various forms of independent thought the bush administration was wise to distinguish

the other posted by hayesap8 august 28 2009 11 01 pm report abuseit s all about dumbing down to make people more malleable there is a lot of momentum still for many of the terrible policies the bush junta enacted the thing about momentum is that if you have enough force you can meet it slow it down and reverse it what would happen is there was a public outcry and people sent a few to the reading rainbow folks a million or two people sending 2 each would solve the problem posted by mtnmanvt august 29 2009 12 11 am report abuselast time i checked mr obama was president of the united states and was in charge of the department of education in fact as far as i know he has been president for over eight months now last time i checked democrats had controlled for some time now the congress which writes the budgets and appropriates funding the explanation placing blame on bush seems to me partisan and tenuous at best i m open to believing there is tie in but given bush has been gone for over eight months now the burden of proving such a tenuous allegation rests with those making such bold statements go ahead give me more facts to show exactly how the bush administration and not the obama administration caused reading rainbow to go off the air i m willing to listen show me funding streams show me budgets show me why it is that the current powers that be could not have stepped in to

jamalc august 29 2009 12 46 am report abusejust because george bush can t speak an intelligent sentence or train of thought doesn t mean that npr should structure a learn to read program just for bush s education when will it end bush influencing anything intelligent like reading rainbow is like asking the fly to eat the fish arse backwards we want npr to change their minds because reading rainbow is a wonderful program for kids it stimulathes their minds and shows them how to be curious about reading and all the possibilities out there to be read it s over bush s head we enjoy learning of the

concern about the disappearance of reading rainbow for parents wanting to find quality educatioal television cyberchase also on pbs is fabulous the 15 min cartoon demonstrates problem solving skills a lot of math and then shows a real world application of the same skills for the last half of the show reading rainbow also did something similiar being able to read is an essential tool for the future which will require problem solving to a degree that we cannot imagine besides reading for enjoyment reading rainbow demonstrated many of the ways reading can help us solve problems teaching why we read is an essential part of my school day as it should be an essential part of educational television bring it back posted by metzx5 august 29 2009 1 16 am report abusei loved reading rainbow i m now in grad school after doing much reading and can t imagine kids growing up without such influences to read reading rainbow wishbone also now defunct and other such shows were an incredible influence

years old i had one young child at the time and soon had two more did they love the show yes but i may have loved it even more i suppose i started watching it because i was a mother but i continued watching it way after my children were grown and out of house i also have a master s degree and am a professional member of the workforce this program is sweet and simple and stimulates everyone to the world around them not just children whenever i happen to be home and it s on t v i make a point to watch it and there s not a child in the house there is something so pure about a show like this and children s books in general don t you agree i m attempting to point out that it s not only children who enjoy reading rainbow for the enchantment and enrichment not to mention the pure charm of levar burton there must be more professionals such as i who adore this program posted by wendy8 august 29 2009 10 52 am report abuseonce again another great pbs program that started during reagan era now ends think about it we have a democrat president full senate and house support by democrats and yet those so called dark times that liberals call the reagan thatcher years spawned indisputably the finest richest and most diverse time in pbs history not to mention the most fund raising as well remember television in those dark times the 80s remember how great it was how many great shows were on network television remember how pbs offered up a host of british imports that we barely get a glimpse at now remember 80s mtv when they actually played music videos rather than produce soft porn reality shows and girls gone wild ads and remember the movies in the 80s dark times i think people are kidding themselves if they don t realize that these are the dark times not the 80s and not during bush either but sure blame him for the demise of reading rainbow if it makes one feel better but it s just not the truth if that even matters any longer for the facts read the education bill that ted kennedy labored over it s not his fault either the authors of the bill and the government pressure on schools to teach reading essentials the ability to read are not to blame pbs is to blame the new tone of pbs that is the pbs of reading rainbow is gone they very clearly could have kept this program on the air or made public it s possible demise if they wished to they did not wish to funds would have been forthcoming in droves if they had they chose to kill it as a teacher i loved rr as well as sesame street and so many other educational programs now defunct or dumbed down or pandering to special interests at the expense of quality and benefit we as a culture will suffer as long as we allow pbs and npr to continue to pander to these special interests like the dept of education and
