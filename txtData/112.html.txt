its two offices located on north earl st and grafton st in dublin s city centre following the announcement to the workers of the planned closure of the outlets on september 6 the transport salaried staffs association tssa balloted members of the union to strike the proposed strike was approved with a 100 vote in favour the events that have led to the present occupation began on friday july 31 with the revelation by the company s uk management brought in especially for the occasion that the offices would be closing ahead of schedule the north earl st staff were brought to the grafton st branch for a meeting with management thereupon the bosses produced a letter stating that the workers were out of the job and detailing their redundancy package five weeks per year of service dropping to two weeks unless workers accept their demands it was recalled by one of the thomas cook workers that someone shouted lock in at which point the workers rushed for the safe room within the building that the management could not enter for lack of the required security code the occupation of the thomas cook offices on grafton st has been in progress since on saturday thomas cook were granted an an interim injunction this was upheld in a high court sitting on monday afternoon the workers in defiance of the over paid judges have voted to carry on the sit in the workers have been eating and sleeping in the building with some taking it in shifts to return home to recuperate according to a second thomas cook worker and tssa member the atmosphere is good people aren t going anywhere we re tired and hungry but we re staying as long as it takes the workers have access to a television however they say it has barely been switched on as they are too excited to watch it the occupying workers have been continuously supplied with food and drinks through an upstairs window and small employers from the local area have also been providing some assistance the workers at thomas cook are fighting for a better redundancy package of the approximately 700 000 offered by the company the workers are asking for an added 300 000 this is being asked in light of the fact that the thomas cook boss in ireland manny fontela novoa was given 7m during 2009 and company profits reached 400m profit in 2008 gerry doherty general secretary of the tssa has stated that if aer lingus can give a redundancy package of nine weeks pay for each year and tesco seven weeks when it made 140 people redundant at dun laoghaire thomas cook whose chief executive manny fontenla novoa received a bonus of 5 million can certainly afford a decent redundancy package for its workers mr doherty while representing the workers at the high court today is also himself expected to face charges by the garda for allegedly physically removing a photographer for the thomas cook company from the premises on grafton st the occupying workers have been supported by most of the left with members of eirig the socialist party socialist workers party sinn f in and the workers solidarity movement present at varying times since the start of the occupation the culmination of this support so far has been the solidarity demonstration on august 3 attended by approximately 200 people members of the left trade unions and the general public the demonstration was prepared in order to obstruct a high court order for the workers to leave the premises by 2pm on the day while over 100 people remained on the demonstration throughout the afternoon in order to blockade the office from invading court bailiffs and garda the state s agents failed to arrive according to demonstrator and member of the workers solidarity movement donal f ll in the fighting spirit of the irish workers is alive and well it s still fresh in our minds how the waterford crystal workers took action as well as the ford visteon workers in belfast and now we see a similar occupation in the heart of the capital it s great to see people taking direct action and not relying on politicians the workers at thomas cook in ireland are simply demanding a larger redundancy package the bosses however know that a victory for the workers means something greater than an additional 300 000 so they will fight the workers to the bitter end they know that a victory for the thomas cook workers would set a precedent for workers everywhere that you can take collective action and that direct action gets the goods the workers are continuing their occupation until their demands are met a victory for the thomas cook workers is a victory for the working class and is a victory for us all assassinato pol tico terrorismo de estado marielle franco presente la huelga general del 8 de marzo un hito hist ricoa interven o federal no rio de janeiro e
