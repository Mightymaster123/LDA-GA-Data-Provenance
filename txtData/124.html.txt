an operation to drive islamic state out of anbar province the announcement was made by a spokesman for the popular mobilisation al hashid al shaabi a force comprising dozens of shia militias he said the operation would see government troops and militiamen move southwards from salahuddin province and seek to cut off is militants in ramadi the provincial capital fell to is this month after iraq s army withdrew since then government forces have been massing for a counter attack in the western province and they say they have regained some ground east of ramadi in the past few days on tuesday fighting was reported south and west of ramadi as the iraqi forces tried to cut off supply routes to the city the offensive has been welcomed by the americans with vice president joe biden pledging full us support the bbc s defence correspondent jonathan marcus says but he adds that washington remains uneasy about the prominent role of shia fighters many of whom are backed by iran separately french foreign minister laurent fabius criticised the iraqi government saying paris had joined a us led coalition last year in carrying out air strikes against is on the basis that baghdad represented the interests of all groups in the country  there is no military solution without a political solution in september we linked the coalition s support to political commitments by the new iraqi government what we call an inclusive policy mr fabius was quoted as saying by reuters  this contract is what justified our military engagement and i say clearly here that it must be better respected he added the popular mobilisation s spokesman ahmed al assadi told a televised news conference that the operation to regain control of anbar would be called labayk ya hussein at your service o hussein a reference to a revered shia imam he said the operation would not last for a long time and that new weapons would be used in the battle that would surprise the enemy mr assadi separately told the afp news agency that a mix of security forces and paramilitaries would move into desert areas north east of ramadi before encircling the city and preparing to retake it islamic state is extremely good at public relations it generates admiration and fear with each of the videos it issues 360 within the last year just about one a day the terror it generates through its gruesome execution videos does a great deal of its work for it and people around the world believe that it is indeed carrying all before it by contrast the iraqi government has not been particularly effective at public relations it has often been slow at telling people of its achievements and foreign journalists in baghdad sometimes have problems trying to find out what the forces are doing and how they are succeeding the result is that there has been real scepticism internationally about the iraqi government s claims to be pushing is back on almost all fronts islamic state pr gloss masks iraqi forces gainsin an interview with the bbc on monday iraqi prime minister haider al abadi said ramadi might be recaptured within days mr abadi also defended the decision of the 1 500 soldiers who had reportedly been stationed in the city to flee in the face of an assault by as few as 150 militants he explained that the soldiers had been fazed by islamic state s shock tactics and did not lack the will to fight as alleged by us defence secretary ashton carter  i am sure he mr carter was fed with the wrong information  they have the will to fight but when they are faced with an onslaught by is from nowhere with armoured trucks packed with explosives the effect of them being blown up is like a small nuclear bomb it gives a very very bad effect on our forces he added fall of ramadi a defeat for american strategy is seized parts of ramadi which is only 100km 60 miles west of the capital baghdad along with the nearby city of falluja and much of anbar in january 2014 the province which is predominantly sunni covers a vast stretch of the country west from baghdad to the syrian border and contains key roads that link iraq to both syria and jordan the us had urged the government not to send shia militias in anbar in case they drove more of anbar s sunnis into supporting the jihadists but after is took complete control of ramadi the popular mobilisation was deployed on saturday it retook the town of husayba east of ramadi mr abadi also told the bbc that the us led coalition needed to help iraq tighten control of its borders as many is fighters were slipping into the country from syria in a separate development britain revealed on tuesday that its reaper drones had carried out successful air strikes on is targets in anbar between 22 may and 24 may uk police launch murder investigation after death
