sportsmanlike in their celebrations over hamilton s misfortune good for kovy he s a good guy and deserved a win you cannot say it is not exciting this year which is really what we want mrspinach on 6061442 kovalainen was 12 1 with the bookies before the start of the race which was his 28th grand prix that s glock s first podium finish and welcome points for toyota hamilton retains the lead in the drivers championship on 62 points raikkonen is second on 57 and massa is third on 54 in the constructors championship ferrari lead on 111 points mclaren jump to second with 100 10 clear of bmw sauber lap 67 kovalainen now 7 2 seconds behind massa the brazilian taking no chances and coasting home raikkonen is now 0 8 seconds behind glock unbelievable massa s out he ground to a halt something s given up at the back of the car it s kovalainen s race the finn is yet to win a grand prix victory today and he d be the 100th winner in f1 history lap 65 hamilton being held off by alonso and there s a suggestion that something s wrong with his car raikkonen like a shark scenting blood is now taking bites out of glock s rear end sutil is finally into the garage and out of the race lap 62 another fastest lap from raikkonen and he s now only 2 8 seconds behind glock can the german hold on for his first podium finish raikkonen taking almighty chunks out of his advantage at the moment sutil of force india is out no he s been waved back into the race still only the one retirement lap 61 massa coasting at the head of the field hamilton has chopped alonso s lead over him to 2 6 seconds they re vying for fifth lap 58 massa bullying the field at the moment although his lead is down to 11 seconds toyota s timo glock is bang on target for his first podium finish although raikkonen is steaming he s just set the fastest lap with 1 21 267 and he s 5 9 seconds behind glock lap 57 still only the one retirement vettel on lap 34 hamilton in sixth is 3 5 seconds behind his best buddy alonso and gaining all the time lap 55 piquet is in for his second pit and hamilton goes comfortably ahead of him and up into sixth piquet and trulli very nearly touch and trulli has to back off and let the brazilian pass massa leads kovy by 14 1 seconds it s looking like a stroll at the moment for ferrari lap 52 hamilton into the points he trails alonso by 4 8 seconds massa is 15 4 seconds ahead of second placed kovalainen raikkonen pits and rejoins in sixth lap 50 alonso into the pits that s a smooth one and he rejoins behind trulli in eighth glock slips to fifth after his second stop lap 48 hamilton in 10th is five seconds behind red bull s webber kovalainen has a 5 5 second lead over massa glock is in for his second pit kovy s is as well and alonso and raikkonen nip ahead of him those two have been at each other s throats all race lap 45 bridgestone have no idea what happened to hamilton s tyres apparently whatever it was it s completely rubbered up any hopes hamilton had of winning this race  after a big lock up at 75mph at turn two you go downhill and i don t think lewis was accelerating hugely and he went off into the gravel and maybe that s where he damaged his tyre going into turn four bbc 5 live commentator david croftlap 44 hamilton is up to 10th but massa has a 23 second lead of second placed kovalainen and ferrari are jubilant massa pits at the end of lap 44 but he s out ahead of glock in third kovalainen of mclaren leads glock is currently the fastest man on the track lap 41 hamilton s off on lap 41 turn five and it looks like he s got a puncture front left the brit limps into the pits and he ll get a set of super softs hamilton out and he bumps into his old mate coulthard who tries to go round the outside but is held off hamilton goes from second to 11th lap 38 massa and hamilton are well into the back markers now there goes button in 13th heidfeld still hasn t pitted although the crew are out there waiting for him lap 36 kovaleinen is 16 3 seconds behind hamilton after 36 laps he and massa are absolutely munching the rest of the field and there s very little between their pace at the moment lap 34 massa leads hamilton by four seconds after 34 laps heidfeld the only man not to pit so far he s in 11th lots of chat between the teams in the pit lanes after that rash of fires there are clearly problems with the refuelling rigs lap 32 massa s lead after 31 laps is 3 3 seconds hamilton has a real tussle on his hands here and not everyone expected that button in on lap 32 he was back in 12th before the stop bourdais s car flares up in the pits that s some sharp work from the man wielding the extinguisher and the toro rosso driver is back out disaster for barrichello they couldn t get the fuel hose in and there was another flash fire there and another nakajima of williams flares up as well all very weird and slightly worrying  i think massa has to push on with what s he got he needs to make most of the clear track while he s got it this track gets pretty crowded and back markers will be a big problem later on bbc 5 live analyst maurice hamiltonlap 30 coulthard in on lap 29 and barrichello like a randy dog sniffs his backside as he rejoins in 14th the scot has switched to harder tyres lap 27 coulthard is fifth but he hasn t been in yet massa three seconds ahead of hamilton after lap 27 coulthard puts in a personal best on his super softs 1 23 085 lap 24 right the dust has settled after a rash of pit stops around lap 20 and the upshot is massa leads after lap 24 hamilton is 2 6 seconds behind and kovy is third piquet pits and rejoins in ninth vettel of toro rosso is the first retirment on lap 25 lap 21 glock in on 20 and that s a lengthy stop he s out in eighth kovy in on lap 21 and he rejoins behind trulli and in eigth lap 19 hamilton s in at the end of 19 no tyre change just a drop of fuel hamilton is now sixth lap 18 strike what i said about raikkonen he s all over the back of alonso i was given a bum steer massa is in at the end of lap 18 harder tyres and a drop of fuel in comes kubica as well massa out in fourth hamilton grabs the lead lap 16 another fastest lap from massa but team mate raikkonen is making no impact on alonso ahead of him in sixth lap 15 we re expecting the drivers to come in for fuel and rubbers around lap 20 massa sets another fastest lap on 15 1 21 414 coulthard really struggling on his softer tyre lapping more than a second slower than piquet in his renault  if massa keeps pushing on he s not going to lose too many places if he s on a three stop strategy bbc 5 live analyst maurice hamiltonlap 13 not much scope for overtaking in hungary so it s all about the tactics and two or three stops webber in eighth is pulling away from trulli who in turn is pulling away from piquet of renault despite the brazilian pulling out some decent lap times massa puts in a 1 21 479 on lap 12 lap 11 that s hamilton s best so far 1 12 9 compared to massa s 1 21 86 on the previous lap a real ding dong between barrichello and vettel for 14th glock pulling away from kubica lap nine kovalainen is well off the pace of massa and hamilton he s obviously carrying more fuel raikkonen hunting alonso down quite a tussle going on between sixth and seventh massa leads hamilton by 2 8 seconds the ferrari driver really ripping into the hungaroring lap eight alonso is up to sixth after taking defending champion raikkonen going into the first corner on lap one massa s lead up to two seconds and all 20 cars are still running lap six massa sets a new fastest lap on lap six and he s beginning to edge away from hamilton the field tightly bunched vettel went wide on lap four and is down to 15th lap three hamilton is the fastest on the track massa s lead after lap three is 1 1 seconds massa will be looking to build as big a lead as possible before pitting two or three laps before hamilton the brazilian will be giving it the hammer the rumour is that massa is running light on fuel and so hamilton is going to have to play a long game here and wait for the tactics at the pit stops lap one it s go go go brilliant start from massa bold and aggressive and he s nipped ahead of hamilton and kovalainen at the first corner actually he overtook hamilton at turn two and kovy at turn one that s spiced things up a bit massa has a 1 3 second lead over hamilton after the first lap glock is up to fourth 1300 drivers are out on the formation lap and it s chaos as the teams make their way to the pit lanes it looks like most drivers are on the harder tyres indeed everyone apart from coulthard apparently 1259 bourdais has commented on the poor conditions at the hungaroring not much grip apparently rubber goes down 1255 round 11 of this year s f1 championship will get under way in five minutes thirty thousand polish fans have swarmed over the border to support their man robert kubica and there s a fair few finnish flags flying in the stands as well hamilton taking a leaf out of michael schumacher s book kept the other drivers waiting ahead of today s parade which smells of the kind of arrogance you need to win the championship 1244 sebastian vettel has just been on the box revealing that he keeps a lucky coin in the laces of his left boot makes a change from a rabbit s foot hanging from your mirror as someone has just aggressively pointed out via text alonso s second title was of course won in 2006 not 1996 why are people so aggressive nowadays broken britain 1241 cars are being manouevred into the grid and the brollies are out it s roasting in budapest toro rosso s sebastien bourdais reckons is very slippery on the track today the frenchman was relegated five grid places to 19th for impeding nick heidfeld in qualifying 1240 the only current driver to have achieved a hat trick of wins is alonso when he was with renault and on the way to his second title in 1996 just prior to schumacher s treble  can t see anyone other than hamilton winning today unless there s a big incident out there it d be nice if kovy could hold on to his place this week as well he s surrendered good positions too easily recently and needs to give mclaren a shot at the constructors championship maccabi on 6061234 coulthard starts in 13th for red bull while jenson button starts in 12th for honda which is not bad considering how he s still grappling with what appears to be a 1981 bedford  if hamilton drives today as he has over the last couple of races then victory will be his again although ron dennis said that heikki can race him i doubt that will really happen elnano on 6061230 good news for hungarian f1 fans and indeed polish fans who reportedly have snapped up a third of the tickets for this year s race organisers today signed a new deal with f1 supremo bernie ecclestone to stage the race through to 2016 1227 britain s david coulthard could do with a couple of points today he s being out performed by team mate mark webber and has done little since his podium finish in canada his pride will be stinging 1223 toyota s timo glock scored his best qualifying position fifth just a day after being cleared to race following a high speed crash last time out in hockenheim a nice little battle within a battle brewing between toyota red bull and renault only two point between the three of them  the circuit has favoured drivers who are kind to their tyres in the past and hammy is hard on his tyres it might be closer than some are suggesting croydon bob on 606 it s dry and hot here with air temperature of 29c and track temperature of 44c but there are some clouds around and the pressure is 41 from our radio 5 live colleagues in hungary1211 what will ferrari come up with today hamilton s mclaren has been all over them like a cheap suit in the last two races tyre choice will be key today given the heat in budapest 1207 alonso apparently hasn t got over his spat with mclaren honcho ron dennis if i was racing for mclaren at this moment maybe i would be in the position i am now without the possibility to win said alonso on thursday i am unable to confirm what brand of handbag he was carrying at the time 1205 it was in hungary that it all kicked off between hamilton and alonso last year during qualifying alonso was found guilty of impeding his then team mate hamilton in the pit lane and was demoted from pole down the field to alonso s probable chagrin hamilton went on to win the race 1200 morning all to the hungaroring where stevenage s lewis hamilton is gunning for his third straight win he grabbed his fourth pole of the season with a coruscating display in qualifying and a win today would make him the first driver since michael schumacher remember him in 2006 to win three grands prix in a row and the first briton since damon hill gonna happen i want you to get involved as much as possible via 606 or text on 81111 join the debate on 606what are these search term copyright 2018 bbc the bbc is not responsible for
