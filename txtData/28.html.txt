began as a specialist in postwar french intellectual history and for much of his life he embodied the idea of the french style engaged intellectual an impassioned left wing zionist as a teenager he shed his faith in agrarian socialism and marxism early on and became as he put it a universalist social democrat with a deep suspicion of left wing ideologues identity politics and the emerging role of the united states as the world s sole superpower his developing interest in europe as a whole including the states of the former eastern bloc led him to take an active role in the developing velvet revolution in czechoslovakia it culminated in postwar a history of europe since 1945 2005 a sweeping richly detailed survey embracing countries from britain to the balkans that in the words of one reviewer has the pace of a thriller and the scope of an encyclopedia mr judt was perhaps best known for his essays on politics and current affairs in journals like the new york review of books the new republic the times literary supplement and the london review of books  he had the unusual ability to see and convey the big picture while at the same time going to the heart of the matter said mark lilla who teaches intellectual history at columbia university most academics do neither they float in between but tony was able to talk about the big picture and explain why it matters now tony robert judt was born in the east end of london on jan 2 1948 and grew up in putney his parents although secular and apolitical jews encouraged him to join the labor zionist youth organization dror as a way to meet friends he became a fervent convert to the cause spending several summers working on a kibbutz in israel and serving as the organization s national secretary from 1965 to 1967  i was the ideal recruit articulate committed and uncompromisingly ideologically conformist he wrote in an autobiographical sketch for the new york review of books in february after he passed the entrance examinations to king s college cambridge he volunteered as an auxiliary with the israeli defense forces during the six day war acting as an interpreter for other volunteers in the newly conquered golan heights there he lost faith in the zionist mission and began to see israel as a malign occupying power whose self definition as a jewish state he later argued made it an anachronism mr judt returned to britain disabused and highly skeptical of the radical political currents swirling around him at cambridge where he earned a bachelor s degree in history from king s college in 1969 after studying for a year at the cole normale sup rieure in paris he returned to king s college and earned a doctorate in 1972 his dissertation on the french socialist party s re emergence after world war i was

published marxism and the french left studies on labour and politics in france 1830 1981 these relatively specialist works led to two interpretive studies of french postwar intellectual life past imperfect french intellectuals 1944 1956 1994 and the burden of responsibility blum camus aron and the french twentieth century 1998 casting his lot with the nonideological liberals like raymond aron and albert camus who dared to criticize the soviet union and third world revolutionary movements he subjected sartre and others to a withering critique that came as a shock to many french and american intellectuals his target he wrote was the uneasy conscience and moral cowardice of an intellectual generation fluidly written with a strong narrative drive and an insistent polemical edge both books established mr judt as a historian whose ability to see the present in the past gave his work an unusual air of immediacy increasingly he inclined toward free ranging inquiry across disciplines pursuing a wide range of his interests reflected in the essay collection reappraisals reflections on the forgotten twentieth century 2008  a historian also has to be an anthropologist also has to be a philosopher also has to be a moralist also has to understand the economics of the period he is writing about he told the online magazine historically speaking in 2006 though they are often arbitrary disciplinary boundaries certainly exist nevertheless the historian has to learn to transcend them in order to write intelligently in 1987 after teaching at cambridge the university of california at berkeley and oxford he began teaching at n y u there in 1995 he helped found the remarque institute with a bequest from paulette goddard the widow of the writer erich maria remarque under his directorship it became an important international center for the study of europe past and present his skepticism about the future of the european union found expression in a sharply polemical pamphlet length book a grand illusion an essay on europe 1996 his first two marriages ended in divorce he is survived by his wife the dance critic jennifer homans and their two sons daniel and nicholas his views on israel made mr judt an increasingly polarizing figure he placed himself in the midst of a bitter debate when in 2003 he outlined a one state solution to the israel palestinian problem in the new york review of books proposing that israel accept a future as a secular bi national state in which jews and arabs enjoyed equal status in 2006 a scheduled talk at the polish consulate in manhattan
