Rat Kidneys Made in Lab Seen as Step to Human Transplants - The New York Times
advertisementby henry fountainapril 14 2013researchers at massachusetts general hospital in boston have made functioning rat kidneys in the laboratory a bioengineering achievement that may one day lead to the ability to create replacement organs for people with kidney disease the scientists said the rat kidneys produced urine in the laboratory as well as when transplanted into rats the kidneys were made by stripping donor kidneys of their cells and putting new cells that regenerate tissue into them stripping an organ leaves a natural scaffold of collagen and other compounds called the extracellular matrix which provides a framework for new cells and preserves the intricate internal architecture of the kidney as well as its basic shape dr harald c ott senior author of a paper describing the research that was published online sunday by the journal nature medicine said that the work was still in its early stages and that there were many hurdles to creating fully functional kidneys for people but he noted that replacement organs made in this way would have advantages over those made with artificial scaffolds or other techniques  the huge benefit would be that it s fully implantable in the shape of a kidney he said about 17 000 people with end stage kidney disease receive a donor organ each year in the united states but more than five times as many patients are on waiting lists in 2011 nearly 5 000 people died while awaiting transplants bioengineered kidneys especially if made using nonhuman sources could ease or eliminate this organ shortage advertisementdr stephen f badylak a researcher at the university of pittsburgh and a pioneer in the use of extracellular matrix in regenerative medicine said that similar work had been done with hearts and other organs advertisement the real value of this study is that it s the kidney and it s a proof of concept and the clinical need is so great said dr badylak who was not involved in the research dr ott developed the technology of stripping organs of their cells called decellularization while at the university of minnesota the process uses a detergent to wash away the living tissue leaving a network of proteins that retains the structure of the blood vessels and other components of the organ in addition to rat kidneys dr ott s group decellularized pig and human kidneys please verify you re not a robot by clicking the box invalid email address please re enter you must select a newsletter to subscribe to view all new york times newsletters to make the regenerated rat kidneys human cells were seeded into the blood vessel portions of the organ and kidney cells from newborn rats were used for the other parts the kidneys were then put into an incubating chamber for up to five days allowing the tissues to grow one problem with using decellularized tissue dr badylak said is that often when the regenerated organ is reconnected to a blood supply clotting occurs after a short time effectively ending the experiment dr ott said his team saw no signs of bleeding or clotting although the transplant experiments were ended after a short time before the kidneys stopped functioning dr ott said that while the bioengineered kidneys produced rudimentary urine they did not function as well as natural ones one reason for this he said may be the relative immaturity of the kidney cells used his group is now working on identifying the kinds of cells to be used to repopulate the organ as for scaling the technique up to work for people dr ott said one approach would be to use decellularized pig kidneys which are readily available and seed them with human cells when a patient needed a new kidney you d take a kidney matrix off the shelf he said then in an ideal world you d take cells from that patient and create a kidney on demand a version of this article appears in print on april 15 2013 on page a10 of the new york edition with the headline rat kidneys made in lab point to aid for humans order reprints today s paper subscribewe re interested in your feedback on this page tell us what you think go to home page
