#OscarsSoWhite’s April Reign: Films are more black this year, ‘not more diverse’
following last year s industry shaking oscarssowhite campaign the 2017 slate of oscar nominations is surely more diverse with the likes of octavia spencer denzel washington and barry jenkins all taking home nominations but according to april reign former attorney managing editor of broadwayblack com and the hashtag s creator the fight for actual diversity and inclusion is not yet over  one year does not make up for over 80 years of underrepresentation of all genders sexual orientations races abilities and first nation status she said to the times oscarssowhite is about the inclusion of all marginalized communities both in front of and behind the camera throughout the entertainment industry films heralded for their diversity this year included fences lion hidden figures and moonlight notable other standouts include the nomination of the first african american cinematographer bradford young for arrival and the first black female editor joi mcmillon for moonlight and many of these films have been commercial successes rebuffing a tired industry belief that diverse films cannot be profitable looks like the academy doesn t think meryl streep is overrated streep received a lead actress nomination tuesday for her role in florence foster jenkins this is the 20th nomination for streep adding to her tally of most acting oscar nominations for a single person katharine hepburn and jack nicholson follow with 12 nominations each streep was first nominated in 1979 in the supporting actress category for her performance in the deer hunter her 20 nominations include 16 for actress in a leading role and four for supporting actress  thank you to the academy for recognizing this extraordinary important film and my work in it thank you denzel for being at the helm that s viola davis rather humble reaction to her oscar nomination this morning for supporting actress for her performance in fences but she deserves more than the standard congratulations davis is now the first african american actress to have scored three academy award nominations whoopi goldberg previously held the record with two having been nominated in 1986 for the color purple actress and finally winning for 1991 s ghost supporting actress dev patel who was nominated for an academy award for actor in a supporting role for his part in lion has big plans for celebrating his nomination news a shower are you freaking out that is the understatement of the century it kind of hasn t fully permeated my brain i m just so overwhelmingly grateful to the universe and the master of that universe garth davis director of lion when black performers were excluded from all acting categories at the academy awards for a second year in a row in 2016 the shutout sparked a second year of an impassioned social media movement oscarssowhite you could say the campaign was a success a week later the academy of motion picture arts and sciences pledged to phase out senior members and enlist new diverse voters who would if all recruiting goals were met double minority membership by 2020 this morning for the first time three black actors were nominated in the same category of best supporting actress viola davis for fences naomie harris for moonlight and octavia spencer for hidden figures denzel washington also was nominated in the lead acting category for his performance in fences and mahershala ali in the supporting actor category for moonlight but hollywood s diversity problem isn t solved by many measures it s still as bad as ever and the studios biggest minority deficit by far involves the very people living and working outside their walls in virtually every direction latinos when executives at lionsgate first entertained the idea of making a film about star crossed lovers who sing and dance their way across los angeles they had good reasons to hesitate the musical genre had been littered with flops including across the universe rent and rock of ages even more worrisome la la land was an
