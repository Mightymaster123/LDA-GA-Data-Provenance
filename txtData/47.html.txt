10th loss in its last 14 games he left a hushed shea stadium took two trains back to his home in norwood n j and composed victory s door which begins with this stanza do you know what it s liketo be chased by the ghost of failurewhile staring through victory s door of course you do you re a mets fan max siegal an associate producer for mets weekly a magazine show on sny the mets cable television channel that has featured mr messina several times said the poet was struggling to express in words what many are feeling  being the poet for the mets is quite a burden especially now he said you re not writing victory songs frank s writing the story of calamity and collapse calamity continued last night the mets lost 7 4 to the marlins while the philadelphia phillies won 6 0 over the nationals taking a one game lead on the last weekend of the regular season mr messina will tell you he is just a mets fan but also one who aspires to speak for all the others in blue and orange as he said

said that s what it is to be a mets fan advertisementmr messina s poems which embrace many topics other than baseball have been printed in books journals and magazines and performed at readings and slams they have been recited from the field at shea stadium by him and read over wfan the sports talk radio station by one of its hosts joe benigno mr messina has no official status with the mets in fact when asked yesterday about him jay horwitz a mets spokesman said he had never heard of mr messina i never knew we had a team poet he said in any case mr messina says his poetry is inspired by his passion not by a desire for recognition when he grew up in norwood it was home to such famous yankees as graig nettles thurman munson and gene michael mr messina s father was a fan of the new york giants baseball team and just as many giants fans did when the team left for san francisco his father became a fan of the fledgling mets to continue rooting against the yankees  my father used to apologize to us for bringing us up as mets fans and making our life so difficult he recalled i started out writing about growing up a mets fan in a yankee town the victories failures and struggles and

blowing down big apple s broadway of meaningless september  most people don t think of baseball as a typical poetry topic but it has everything in human nature that makes for great writing mr messina said recently in an interview it has victories and failures and struggles and angst mr messina writes about some of the regulars in his section at shea like the man whose body is covered in met tattoos and the old beer vendor who wears his purple heart medal on his cap and relates his story about the battle of the bulge advertisementmr benigno who is also a die hard mets fan and like mr messina talks as if he is working behind a new jersey deli counter knows something about sports fan poetry mastering such everyday guy phrases as who s better than you and what are you kidding me  no one would question a poet writing about love for a woman but when you re a fan of a team the emotional attachment is even stronger because women come and go but your team never changes mr benigno said people who are not sports fans don t understand that while mr messina and other mets loyalists worry about what this final weekend of the regular season will bring the fans of the phillies are more accustomed to season finale heartbreaks this time the mets swoon has accompanied a phillies ascent and the fans are taking particular pleasure in the mets woes al lesky 56 from shamong township n j near philadelphia remarked on philadelphia teams history of losing seasons the city has not won a major sports championship since 1983 and the fans still smart from the phillies remarkable 1964 late season slide after leading by 6 games late in the season the team lost the last 10 games and the pennant  so maybe this year it will be some kid in north jersey or connecticut who will remember 20 years from now the mets collapse mr lesky said mike harris a parking lot developer who plays basketball at the sporting club at the bellevue a gym in philadelphia was optimistic about the phillies  i figure they will win two of three and get in he said i ve never felt that way before since it is like a philadelphian to think negatively somehow things are different this year mr messina is also optimistic he describes a mets collapse as having the epic proportions of the sacking of troy or lear losing his daughters still he insists his mets will pull out a win by the skin of their cleats and that the phillies wind up in mudville robert strauss contributed reporting a version of this article appears in print on on page a1 of the new york edition with the headline he s poet of the mets and
