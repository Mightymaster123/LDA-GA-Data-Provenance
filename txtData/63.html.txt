perraudinsat 27 may 2017 06 23 edt first published on fri 26 may 2017 05 01 edtdetectives investigating the manchester arena bombing say they have got hold of a large part of the network and made immense progress in arresting people suspected of assisting salman abedi who killed 22 concertgoers on monday night britain s top counter terrorism officer mark rowley said on friday that while there were still important lines of inquiry to pursue and further arrests were likely the public should go out as you planned and enjoy yourselves over the bank holiday weekend he said detectives had made very significant arrests and some significant finds  clearly we haven t covered all the territory we want to but we have covered a large part of it so our confidence has been increasing in recent days he said but there s still more to do the guardian understands there is no positive evidence that a device exists in the possession of a terrorist about to execute another attack although investigators say this can not be ruled out the threat level is set to remain at critical throughout the weekend at least meaning an attack is still considered imminent overnight on friday police arrested another two men officers used a controlled explosion to access an address in cheetham hill where the men were arrested neighbours identified two men taken away from the property as brothers yahya and mohamed werfalli who appear to be linked to the manchester bomber on social media police also raided a new property in moss side residents in nearby houses were evacuated on saturday morning and a bomb disposal team was seen in at the address the operation in the early hours of saturday morning brings the number of suspects being held in custody to 11 rowley said detectives were striving to understand everything we can about the dead terrorist his associates the whole network and how they acquired and built the bomb that exploded on monday night investigators believe aspects of the way the bomb was built point towards the maker having made improvised explosive devices before it showed considerable power and the nuts and bolts had been packed to maximise their murderous effect they also believe the attack involved a significant change in terrorist planning spotting a weak point when people were leaving an event it is a new style of attack striking when the security focus is on helping the crowd getting out safely a source said since the attack police have reviewed security at more than 1 300 events across the country extra armed police will patrol the fa cup final at wembley where armoured vehicles will be deployed and the rugby premiership final at twickenham while 50 more firearms officers have been deployed on the streets including some who were seen patrolling

was arrested on suspicion of terrorism offences detectives said they had taken accounts from hundreds of witnesses and were reviewing hours of cctv footage financial and communication records of suspects and are making international inquiries they were also focused on understanding abedi s life which saw him travelling back and forth between libya and manchester after his father returned to his home country in 2011 the security minister ben wallace said earlier on friday we are trying to roll up a network this is not a lone individual he described the investigation as still very live it is still very hot it also emerged that the security service mi has opened files and examined 23 000 people for allegedly supporting violent jihad a pool of 20 000 have been subjects of interest but not deemed worth investigating further as posing a danger of involvement in attacks the figures were released to make the point that mi5 has to prioritise who it can investigate at any one time amid criticism that it failed to spot the danger posed by abedi despite information from muslims his behaviour was concerning in the pool of 20 000 was the manchester attacker and also michael adebolajo and michael adebowale who murdered lee rigby in 2013 mi5 has resources to investigate 3 000 suspects and is currently running 500 investigations the greater manchester police chief constable ian

help with inquiries on wednesday night when he saw abedi s photograph on tv he made the connection straight away he was shocked and panicked when he saw the news greater manchester police said on friday that a 38 year old man was arrested in blackley on thursday elhudarey says his friend thought there was something odd going on in the flat and suspected abedi may have been smoking drugs but it never occurred to him that he could be making a bomb he said abedi left the flat in a hurry after about six weeks around march telling elwafi he needed to fly to libya and leaving behind many of his
