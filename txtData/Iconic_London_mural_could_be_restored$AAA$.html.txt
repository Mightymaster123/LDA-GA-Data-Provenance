Iconic London mural could be restored - Wikinews, the free news source
monday september 20 2010 one of london s most well known murals could be restored after years of neglect if plans by a group of community activists gain public support the fitzrovia mural at whitfield gardens on london s tottenham court road was created by two mural artists and commissioned by camden council in 1980 but the mural has since decayed and been vandalised plans will be presented at a public meeting this tuesday to include details of the restoration and promote local public space in contrast to potential commercial developments and the focus of the london 2012 olympics if enough funds are raised from charitable trusts and public donations the mural could be restored during the summer of 2011 plans to be put forward by the fitzrovia neighbourhood association and the london mural preservation society will present ways to fund not only the restoration work but also projects to raise awareness of conservation heritage and the residential and working community the heritage and mural project hopes to involve many local people who could learn new conservation skills also planned are workshops with local children to involve them in their heritage an exhibition by local artists guided tours and a celebratory event at the end of the restoration project in addition to this a booklet would be produced containing collected oral histories of the people involved and a preservation trust to protect the mural in future years the playful painting was created on a camden council owned building in 1980 by artists mick jones son of the late jack jones trade union leader and simon barber and is a mash up of scenes depicting problems faced by the neighbourhood over the preceding decade there is also a caricature of poet dylan thomas who lived in fitzrovia and a mocking portrayal of then leader of the greater london council conservative politician horace cutler who is pictured as a bat like creature other characters include an anonymous greedy developer and a property speculator counting piles of cash peter whyatt of the neighbourhood association is jointly leading the project to restore the mural yesterday he told wikinews he had a number of concerns about the possible success of the project  there are a great number of problems with getting this project off the ground and we also need to act pretty quickly for a number of reasons said mr whyatt  firstly the mural is in a terrible state and deteriorating quickly there is more graffiti being daubed on the site every month because one bit of graffiti attracts another bit we really need to start the work in the next 12 months because going through another winter with the condition of the wall will causes more problems and inevitably more expense we want to keep as much original artwork on the site as possible to keep the costs down this is a big mural and it will be expensive to restore he continued  and that brings me to my second concern cost if we don t get other community organisations on board to bid for money for this with us and to involve their beneficiaries and volunteers it will be very difficult to secure the money needed money is very tight at the moment because to the current financial climate we need to get support at this meeting on tuesday and some firm commitments from people and organisations to get involved  lastly there is a danger of a commercial development on the site a public private partnership to create a new art feature because of the existing mural s subject matter it mocks property speculators and land developers etc a commercial scheme probably backed by a property developer would not want to restore the mural s original message they d want some good news scheme some greenwash idea that paints them in a positive light  however despite these problems camden council have offered to do a condition survey on the mural this will save us a lot of money but having said that there are five council departments to deal with to get permission for this restoration work and they don t always talk to each other  but if the public and local voluntary organisations show their support we can make it happen mr whyatt concluded the mural restoration will be just one part of a year long project of heritage and conservation awareness raising the project is not just about the mural but also wider plans to promote awareness of heritage and conservation in an area of london under threat from commercial development in fact the bulk of the project is about the heritage and conservation and the mural is just one part of it and the most visible because of its situation mr whyatt later added there will be a public meeting about the heritage and mural project at 7 30 pm tomorrow tuesday at the neighbourhood centre 39 tottenham street the public can also comment about the proposals on the fitzrovia heritage and mural website have an opinion on this story share it share this this page is archived and is no longer publicly
