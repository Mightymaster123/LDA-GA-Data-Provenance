servicenew delhi march 24 the delhi development authority regularised encroachment and unauthorised construction of school buildings by a private school on its land and took no action to recover damages calculated as rs 35 07 lakh despite a lapse of over 10 years the comptroller and auditor general s report has blamed the dda s lackadaisical attitude for its inability to protect its interests the dda allots land to educational societies recommended by the directorate of education of the government of nct of delhi for setting up and running of schools subject to fulfilment of certain specified conditions and at rates determined by the dda in accordance with the rules failure to adhere to the terms of payment of the premium ground rent etc fixed for allotment of the land renders the allotment liable for cancellation as well as for action to recover pending dues in april 1988 the dda allotted a plot of land measuring 3 228 acre at saraswati garden to the dav college management committee at rs 8 lakh per acre for construction of a school on payment of the premium and ground rent of rs 16 40 lakh in may 1988 the plot was handed over to the committee in july 1988 subsequently the residents of the locality objected to the construction of the school at the site the report says in february 1989 the management committee requested the dda for allotment of an alternative site without waiting for a formal allotment the dav committee entered into an agreement with the reserve bank staff cooperative housing society in august 1989 for construction of the school at a plot in paschim vihar in december 1989 dda formally offered the same plot measuring 2 492 acre at paschim vihar to the committee at a rate of rs 23 75 lakh per acre instead of acting on the offer the college management committee took up the construction of the school which was completed in three phases between 1990 and 1995 the cag notes  though this land belonged to dda and not to the rbi staff co operative housing society dda took no notice till 5 august 1993 when it issued a showcause notice to the committee treating the school as an encroachment and an unauthorised construction the report cites on august 25 1993 dda offered to regularise the unauthorised encroachment subject to the condition that the allotment shall be made at the current rates and damages will be paid by the committee for the period of unauthorised occupation of the site on acceptance of these terms the land was allotted to the committee in december 1993 at the rate of rs 23 75 lakh per acre the committee deposited the premium in june 1996 in january 1999 dda issued a notice requiring the committee to pay the damage charges which had amounted to rs 35 07 lakh despite an assurance given in july 1998 to pay the damage charges the committee failed to pay the damage charge however no action was taken and the damages remained unpaid as of june 2005 viz even after the expiry of seven years from the date of issue of notice  thus lackadaisical approach of the dda in protecting its interests had enabled the committee to obtain unauthorised possession of dda land and thereafter even construct a school building over a period of three years without eliciting any reaction the report points out while the matter was referred to the ministry in august 2004 and a reminder issued in july 2005 their reply was
