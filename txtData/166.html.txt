servicefaridabad march 28 the brick kiln may be a useful thing when it comes to construction work but their large number could turn them into a blot on the land as a brick kiln could have major side effects like damaging the overall fertility of the land and disturbing the ecology of an area through acute pollution the existence of around 182 brick kilns has been a cause of concern for residents of the district expressing concern over the failure of the authorities to limit the number of brick kilns in the district prominent congress party leader and former mla rajender singh bisla has said it is a matter of grave concern that a large number of brick kilns have come up in the adjoining areas of the city and the district after a ban was imposed on such structures in certain parts of the neighboring districts of up a few years ago in areas where there was acute shortage of sweet underground water brick kilns consume a large amount of water besides damaging the upper crust of fertile land between five and eight feet rendering it useless a recent survey of the area found that many farmers in the nearby villages were engaged in leasing out agricultural land for such purposes on the assumption that their land could be acquired by the government mr bisla said the reports revealed a large number of brick kilns had come up in the adjoining areas especially in hodal and ballabgarh subdivisions in the recent past it was claimed that about 50 brick kilns in agra district of up were shut down following court orders due to the threat of pollution some of these had reportedly shifted to hodal subdivision according to experts there could be several fallouts of the presence of a brick kiln in an area these included pollution loss of fertility of the land damage to the underground water level and loss to overall agricultural production it was stated that there could be no diversification of farming in such an area and the land could not be used till it was filled up again which required lots of funds and effort reportedly the level of underground water which had been 40 to 50 feet a few years ago had gone down to 100 feet or more in a majority of the areas leading to depletion of the sweet water resources faridabad is one of those districts where the availability of sweet water is very low a majority of the densely populated colonies in the city face an acute water shortage throughout the year though the setting up of brick kilns requires permission from the pollution control department and certain norms are required to be followed it is alleged that rules get circumvented due to corruption and pollution was still a major problem court irked by delay in trial tribune news servicenew delhi march 28 irked over the non examination of prosecution
