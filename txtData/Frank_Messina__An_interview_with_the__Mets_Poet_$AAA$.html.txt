wednesday october 3 2007 share this in the early olympic games athletes used to run a mile and then recite a poem the first poet in residence of an english football team ian mcmillan remarked that football chants are like huge tribal poems generally though sport and poetry have never seemed natural companions in human enterprise until the new york mets baseball team suffered in 2007 arguably the worst collapse in major league baseball history to describe the anguish fans felt the new york times turned to a poet frank messina nothing was really representing the fan s point of view messina told wikinews reporter david shankbone in an interview there s a lot of hurting people out there who can t express what happened and to those who read the times last saturday messina wants you to know his father never apologized for raising him as a mets fans i never asked for his apology and he never apologized nor did he owe us one i was misquoted in the new york times messina s parents taught him about opposite ends of the spectrum of life my mother was supportive even when i made mistakes she taught me to never give up no matter what vocation you choose in your life whereas messina s mother taught him to never give up his father taught him how to die with grace he passed away from cancer in 2005 i got to see a man who accepted his fate he was like the captain of the titanic my mother was also calm i was the one freaking out inside i saw someone who had acknowledged his own demise accepted it and died at home he was a tough old guy it takes a lot to accept that it takes a very strong person some of the special moments toward the end was sitting with him and watching baseball games it is baseball that has garnered messina attention now he has performed in 32 countries and 40 states and in 1993 he founded the band spoken motion a spoken word band what is striking about messina is that his work has branched two worlds that often don t interact downtown coffeehouse denizens of poetry and the denizens of shea stadium it is frank messina who has personalities as diverse as joe benigno the archetype of the new york sportscaster at wfan reflecting on love and poetry no one would question a poet writing about love for a woman said benigno but when you re a fan of a team the emotional attachment is even stronger benigno sounded similar to avant garde writer and musician david amram who said messina s poems paint the stark beauty of the streets the pain of 9 11 the joy of everyday life the mysteries of love all fill the pages of this book it s a feast of

while staring through victory s door of course you do you re a mets fan caught in a do or die moment in late september at sheaas one that s battled hard through many a broken dream let me say in order
