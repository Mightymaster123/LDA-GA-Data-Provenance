the iowa caucuses on thursday night lifted by what appeared to be a record turnout of voters who rejected the criticism that he did not have enough experience mr obama s victory amounted to a significant setback for senator hillary rodham clinton of new york who just months ago appeared to be the front runner for the democratic presidential nomination but has watched her position erode over the past several months the result also left uncertain the prospects for john edwards a former senator from north carolina who had staked his second bid for the white house on winning this state speaking to supporters after declaring victory mr obama said they said this day would never come they said our sights were set too high they said this country was too divided too disillusioned to come together over a common purpose he continued you have done what the cynics said you couldn t do you have done what the state of new hampshire can do in five days you have done what america can do in this new year 2008 we are one nation we are one people and the time for change has come advertisementon the republican side mike huckabee the former governor of arkansas who was barely a blip on the

distant fourth with 2 1 percent of the vote most of the other democratic efforts were rolled off the map unable in many districts to gain the 15 percent needed to become viable including those of senators christopher j dodd of connecticut joseph r biden jr of delaware and mr richardson both mr biden and mr dodd later dropped out of the race competitive campaigns and compelling candidates in both parties sparked record turnouts exceeding every previous iowa caucus and everyone s expectations an estimated 220 000 democrats showed up at caucus sites compared to 124 000 in 2004 about 114 000 republicans turned out the last contested republican caucuses in 2000 drew about 88 000 george w bush then the governor of texas won among democrats that produced scenes of overcrowded firehouses and schools and long lines of people waiting to sign in mr obama s victory in this overwhelmingly white state stood as a powerful answer to the question of whether america was prepared to vote for a black person for president at the same time the apparent surge of independent voters to his side as suggested by polls of voters entering the caucuses suggested his potential appeal in a general election the result sent waves of apprehension across mrs clinton s camp and she turned her attention to new hampshire aides said that former president bill clinton would go there immediately and spend the next five days campaigning in a state where he has always been strong advertisementsenator clinton flanked by her husband and madeleine albright the former secretary of state congratulated senator

undaunted by her third place showing in iowa she said she had always intended to run a national campaign and she would go forward beginning in new hampshire on friday i am so ready for the rest of the campaign and i am so ready to lead mr edwards declared the one thing that s clear with the results in iowa tonight is the status quo lost and change won on the republican side mr romney had blanketed the state with television advertisements and with a nod to the way campaigns are normally won here built an extensive get out the vote operation that carted mr romney s supporters to the polls all day

appeal powered by support from evangelicals out muscled a political operation that mr romney spent more than a year building polls of republicans entering the caucus sites found that nearly 60 percent described themselves as evangelical christians and by overwhelming numbers they said they intended to vote for mr huckabee a survey of democrats entering the caucus sites found that more than half said they were attending their first caucus and they divided with about 40 percent for mr obama and about 30 percent for mrs clinton there was also a sharp generational break in support of the two candidates mr obama was backed by 60 percent of voters under 25 while mrs clinton was supported by about 45 percent of voters over 65 among democrats nearly half of respondents said that their top factor in choosing a candidate was someone who could bring about change mr obama won the support of about half that group just 20 percent said the right experience mrs clinton s key argument was the main factor among that group nearly half chose mrs clinton for all the talk about electability barely one in 10 respondents said it was the main factor in their decision mrs clinton and mr edwards had an edge over mr obama in this area advertisementthe personal quality republican voters said mattered most in a candidate was that they shared their values what mattered second most was that a candidate said what he believed mr huckabee outpolled mr romney in both of those groups the republican race was relatively straightforward mr romney and mr huckabee were the main contestants with none of the other candidates devoting much time or money to the state mr giuliani made intermittent efforts here mr mccain at one point all but wrote off the state but returned after he won the endorsement of the des moines register and saw with the rise in polls of mr huckabee an opportunity to finish third for democrats the contest had historic overtones a battle between a first term senator mr obama trying to become the nation s first black president and a former first lady mrs clinton seeking to become the first woman to occupy the oval office the democratic caucus results do not reflect the actual percentage of people who expressed a preference for a particular candidate rather they are the percentage of delegates allocated to each of the candidates based on a complex formula the democratic party does not release the actual number of democrats who caucus for each candidate the republican results reflect a direct count of the preferences expressed by those who participated in the republican caucuses mirroring the unusual rush of the nominating calendar the primary in new hampshire is a mere five days away the major candidates planned to pick up as soon as the caucus results were known and flew to new hampshire to be on the ground for early morning rallies television appearances and campaign stops mrs clinton s campaign plane was scheduled to leave iowa at midnight the one exception was mr giuliani who largely skipped the iowa caucuses he started the day in new hampshire and spent the rest of it in florida the voting on thursday ended what was one of the most intense years of politicking in the history of the iowa caucuses television advertisements for all the major candidates were aired right up until the time iowans were leaving their homes or being picked up for the 7 p m start of the caucuses as the day moved on the candidates and some spouses like bill clinton were doing interviews with iowa television and radio stations the campaigns meanwhile began executing the most sophisticated voter turn out operations ever seen in iowa as campaign workers began calling people who had long ago been identified as supporters to make certain they would show up to make their preferences known advertisementthe inducements included free rides to caucus sites baby sitting and food in a development that both mr obama and mrs clinton had hoped for the day was snow free and the single digit temperatures of earlier in the week were gone the theory was that supporters of mr edwards were experienced caucusgoers who were used to dealing with bad weather mr obama had sought to expand the universe of caucusgoers by appealing to young voters while mrs clinton was looking for first time caucusgoers among younger women and women over 65 we re
