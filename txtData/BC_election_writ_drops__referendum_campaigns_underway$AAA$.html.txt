members of parliament in ottawa the other system is bc stv which would replace 85 single member ridings with 20 larger ridings in which between two and seven members of the legislative assembly mla would be elected the total number of mlas will not change voters would rank the candidates in order of preference as many or as few as they wish when the results are tallied votes are transferred to the next preference on the ballot when the first preference has been elected or eliminated the system is designed to ensure that every vote helps to elect someone every vote counts as fully as possible and every voter is represented by a candidate they voted for as nearly as mathematically possible previous elections held under the current single member plurality also known as first past the post system led to odd results in certain elections such as the 2001 election where the winning party obtained 77 of the 79 seats of the legislature with just 58 of the vote and the 1996 election in which the party with the most votes failed to win the election the recommendation to switch to stv was made by the british columbia citizens assembly on electoral reform a group formed in 2004 of randomly selected citizens they spent a year learning about voting systems around the world and consulting with bc citizens it s the fourth referendum in the country and the second in the province within the last 4 years the previous referendum held in 2005 also voted on these same electoral systems and came within 2 3 of the 60 threshold in order for the referendum to be binding bc stv will again need 60 of the popular vote and 50 of votes in 51 of the 85 ridings in bc if the change is approved it will be the first province in the country to adopt reform of the electoral system in recent history fair voting bc recognized as the official proponent group argues that stv will lead to fairer election results effective local representation and greater voter choice they argue that bc stv will give voters the power to hold politicians and political parties accountable by giving every voter a vote that actually makes a difference if the stv system is approved then it will be put into use for the first time for the 2013 provincial election the recognized opponent group is the no stv campaign society their arguments are that stv will give larger ridings voters would be unsure of whom their mla would be there would be unequal geographic representation that the counting method is too complicated the electoral system results are unverified in practical usage the system results in a higher probability of minority governments and the subsequent coalition of parties they also argue that other countries who use systems similar to stv have had problems with their election results  500 000 in public funding has been given to both the proponents and the opponents of the referendum have an opinion on this story share it share this this page is archived and is no longer
