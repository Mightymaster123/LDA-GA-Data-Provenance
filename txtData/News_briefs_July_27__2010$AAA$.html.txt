best known for co creating the pioneering role playing game dungeons dragons d d with dave arneson was born in chicago within a few blocks of wrigley field in 1938 the son of swiss immigrant and chicago symphony orchestra violinist ernst gygax gary spent his early childhood in chicago but in 1946 after he was involved in a brawl with a large group of boys his father decided to move the family to lake geneva wisconsin where gary s mother s family had settled in the early 19th century during his childhood and teen years he developed a love of games and an appreciation for fantasy and science fiction literature which his father introduced to him through pulp novels at the age of ten he and his friends played the sort of games that eventually came to be called live action role playing games with one of them acting as a referee his interest in games combined with an appreciation of history eventually led gygax to begin playing miniature war games in 1953 with his best friend don kaye by december 1958 the game gettysburg from the avalon hill company had particularly captured gygax s attention and he ordered from the company the first blank hexagon mapping sheets that were available which he then employed to design his own games he looked for innovative ways to generate random numbers and used not only common six sided dice but dice of all five platonic solid shapes which he discovered in a school supply catalog gygax soon became active in fandom and by 1965 he was active in the wargame hobby and was writing many magazine articles on the subject during the 1960s as gygax was working as an insurance underwriter for the firemen s fund in lake geneva in 1966 he co founded the international federation of wargamers ifw with bill speer and scott duncan the ifw which was created by combining several preexisting wargaming clubs aimed to promote interest in role playing games especially those set in the medieval period and provided a forum for international wargamers in 1968 gygax rented lake geneva s vine covered horticultural hall for 50 to hold the first lake geneva convention also known as the gen con gaming convention for short and in 1969 he met dave arneson the future co creator of dungeons dragons at the second gen con by 1970 gary had left the insurance business and became a shoe repairman to make more time for pursuing his interest in game development and began working as editor in chief at guidon games a publisher of wargames for which he produced the board games alexander the great and dunkirk in 1971 that same year his and jeff perren s chainmail a miniatures wargame that simulated medieval era tactical combat was published and in 1972 he added a fantasy supplement to the rules this supplement included warriors who were monsters of non human races drawn from the works of tolkien and other sources he also included rules for individual heroic characters including wizards which included ten spells that could be used to affect a battle including lightning bolts and fireballs dave arneson who had written the game blackmoor adopted these new fantasy rules into his game and while visiting lake geneva in 1972 he and gygax immediately saw the potential of role playing games gygax and arneson collaborated on the fantasy game the role playing game that later became dungeons dragons d d in 1973 gygax quit his day job and attempted to publish the game through avalon hill who turned down his offer so together with don kaye as a partner in 1973 he founded the publishing company tactical studies rules later known as tsr inc with an initial investment of 1000 each however this did not give them enough capital to publish the rules for dungeons dragons and worried that other companies would be able to publish similar projects first the two convinced acquaintance brian blume to join tsr in 1974 as an equal one third partner this brought the financing that enabled them to publish dungeons dragons dungeons dragons was first released by tsr in january 1974 as a boxed set a hand assembled print run of 1 000 copies put together by hand in gygax s home sold out in less than a year that same year he also created the magazine the strategic review with himself as editor which later became known as dragon magazine then sadly in 1975 don kaye unexpectedly died of a heart attack in january at the age of 36 as kaye had not made any specific provision in his will regarding his one third share of the company his share of tsr passed to his wife a woman whom gygax characterized as less than personable and who dumped all the tactical studies rules materials off on my front porch it would have been impossible to manage a business with her involved as a partner however two years later in 1977 a new version of d d advanced dungeons dragons ad d was published the monster manual released later that year became the first supplemental rule book of the new system and many more followed over the next few years and by 1980 sales of the dungeons dragons game reached 8 5 million dungeons dragons reached mainstream notoriety when negative media attention focused on dungeons dragons in 1982 patricia pulling s son killed himself blaming dungeons dragons for his suicide and pulling formed an organization named b a d d bothered about dungeons dragons to attack the game and the company that produced it by 1984 gygax discovered that tsr had run into serious financial difficulties and was 1 5 million in debt in october 1985 tsr s board of directors removed gygax as the company s president and chairman of the board sales of dungeons dragons reached 29 million by 1985 but gygax seeing his future at tsr as untenable left the company on december 31 1985 gygax continued to write new books and games and in the intervening 20 years he became something of a cult nerd hero culminating in a famous episode of the fox cartoon series futurama in which he nichelle nichols from the original star trek series the famed physicist stephen hawking and us vice president al gore each lent their voices as a team of vice presidential action rangers whose task is to protect the space time continuum in fact gary gygax s appearance alongside al gore is something of an inside joke since gore s wife tipper hates dungeons dragons and has been publicly critical of it a lifelong cigarette smoker gygax went into semi retirement after suffering strokes on april 1 and may 4 2004 and almost suffered a heart attack after receiving incorrect medication to prevent further strokes in late 2005 he was diagnosed with an inoperable abdominal aortic aneurysm yet despite his reduced workload gygax continued to be active in the gaming community then on march 4 2008 gygax died at his home in lake geneva at age 69 gygax married his first wife mary jo gygax in 1958 by 1961 they had two children who would later assist with play testing dungeons dragons three more children were to follow before the marriage ended in divorce in the early 1980s on august 15 1987 the same day as his parents 50th wedding anniversary he married his second wife gail carpenter and together they had his sixth and last child by 2005 gygax had seven grandchildren gygax s influence is still strongly felt across the gaming community as a whole the popular online role playing game world of warcraft dedicated a patch to the franchise in his honor numerous webcomics make reference to him and even faux conservative stephen colbert avid d d gamer in his youth dedicated the last part of the march 5 2008 episode of the colbert report to gygax
