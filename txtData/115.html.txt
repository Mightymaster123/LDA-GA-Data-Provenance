too generously as new data show the decline in pupils getting at least a c in english more than 600 schools in england wales and northern ireland saw a fall of 10 or more in the proportion of pupils achieving grades a c on last year the figures indicate the scale of this summer s english gcse grading debacle in its final report on the controversy exams watchdog ofqual says pressure to get good grades saw teachers overmark the new data given to the education select committee in response to questions it raised of ofqual in relation to the grading row shows 611 schools saw a decrease of 10 or more in the number of candidates getting a c in english head teachers have said that tens of thousands of students received lower gcse english grades than expected this year mainly around the c d border the fiasco centres around the controlled assessment aspect of the new modular english gcse qualification sat for the first time this summer controlled assessment is gcse coursework which is sat in the classroom under strict supervision and marked by teachers ofqual which regulates exams in england and vocational qualifications in northern ireland says teenagers have been let down by an exams system where teachers are under intense pressure to achieve good grades its report says teachers in some of england s secondary schools were guilty of significantly over marking pupils gcse english work this summer in order to boost results  the regulator concludes that so much weight on one grade in one subject as part of accountability and performance measures created perverse incentives for schools in the way they marked controlled assessment and led to the over marking the report says but glenn smith principal of honiton community college in devon told the bbc that teachers in his english department used stringent measures to ensure they were marking these assessments fairly and consistently  an awful lot of work goes into ensuring their marking is accurate the pressure they live with is intense he said  to say they ve marked up is outrageous philip rush deputy head teacher at st peter s high school gloucester said the fiasco surrounding the unfairness of this summer s grades is a political not an educational fiasco  st peter s high school deplores the slur made on the school s teachers and on all english teachers working in england by ofqual s comments and seeks to have them withdrawn val tyreman a science teacher from stockton on tees described ofqual s report as appalling  i cannot understand how they can blame teachers if external moderation procedures were properly applied i don t see how teachers can be accused of generous marking john townsley executive principal of two academy schools in leeds said the problem is that ofqual were asleep in the early part of the award  and that meant that many cs were given out generously in june 2011 and jan 2012 resulting in very little being left for the students at the end of the course that s fundamentally unfair and it s not addressed in this report malcolm trobe deputy general secretary of the association of school and college leaders said for ofqual to suggest that teachers and schools are to blame is outrageous and flies in the face of the evidence  the accountability measures do place tremendous pressure on teachers and schools especially at gcse grade c but to say that teachers would compromise their integrity to the detriment of students is an insult russell hobby general secretary of the national association of head teachers said it is a diversion to attempt to blame teachers for following the rules they were given  if your elected government tells you this is the right thing to do if your performance is measured on it and if you are sacked for failing to achieve it you have no choice but to do it teachers anger over the marking fiasco was reflected in a survey in the times education supplement the survey of 467 secondary schools in england found 93 had lost faith in ofqual with more than half saying they had no confidence in the regulator responding to the survey schools described the watchdog as underhand incompetent bullying and callous and a gove puppet speaking to bbc radio four s today programme ofqual chief executive glenys stacey said she believed teachers had marked the test optimistically rather than with a deliberate intention to inflate grades she said teachers are not making up marks here they are doing their level best to do the best for their students and they are bound given the pressures they are under to take the most optimistic view  there s an amount of tolerance some leeway in the marking but if enough teachers mark up to that tolerance mark up to that limit then overall it has a national effect she added this summer s english gcses were a new modular qualification with pupils sitting written exam papers and controlled assessment and schools decided when pupils submitted that assessment work and sat exams ofqual s research found many schools used the marks pupils received in their first exams and the january grade boundaries to work out what score a pupil would need in their controlled assessment to get a certain grade and marked it accordingly most of the controlled assessment work was submitted in the summer and when examiners saw evidence of over marking exam boards raised grade boundaries leading some pupils to receive poorer grades than expected in wales ministers ordered a regrade for pupils who got a lower grade than expected with welsh board wjec but ofqual did not order such a move in england now an alliance of pupils schools councils and professional bodies has launched a legal challenge over the fiasco calling for results to be re graded schools in england are measured on the percentage of pupils who get five a c gcses including english and maths this measure is included in league tables with schools expected to have at least 40 of students reaching this standard the ofqual report says the new qualifications reinforced the trend of schools running the gcse schools years years 10 and 11 as a tactical operation to secure certain grades and combinations of grades  this has come to be seen as what good schools do despite the awareness of many teachers and parents that the concept of broad and deep learning can get lost along the way it says ofqual says it will take action to ensure there are no repeats of this year s problems in 2013 the watchdog also says this year s debacle proves the proposal by education secretary michael gove to end the modularisation of gcses in england by 2014 is correct ms stacey said the new modular english gcses at the heart of the fiasco were too flexible and not sufficiently resilient to take the pressure they were put under  it is so flexible that when subjected to the pressure of the accountability system it can buckle she said the bbc is not responsible for the content of external internet sitesboris johnson agrees the
