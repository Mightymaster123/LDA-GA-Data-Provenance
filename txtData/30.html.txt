the cnn broadcast center in new york this is a special two hour edition of anderson cooper 360 cooper good evening a special two hour edition because there are a lot of developments to tell you about not only in the terri schiavo case but also in the school shooting case in minnesota we begin tonight however with the latest in the terri schiavo situation we have just heard that the state judge who ordered her feeding tube disconnected will now hear new evidence that she may not be in a vegetative state there are a lot of fine points to talk about let s get the very latest joining us live outside the hospice in florida is cnn s john zarrella john try to bring us up to date john zarrella cnn correspondent anderson yes it was a fast moving today both in the courts and at the florida legislative level and with governor bush first of all the 11th circuit court of appeals turned down the family s request for intervention meaning that on the federal level the next stop and last stop would be the united states supreme court the florida senate in a 21 to 18 vote late this afternoon turned down voted no on a bill that might have allowed for terri schiavo s feeding tube to be put back in to be reinserted so legislative action in the state of florida at this point now not going anywhere and it is dead but then about the same time governor jeb bush took to the podium in tallahassee and said there was compelling new evidence and he was going to order the department of children and families here in florida dcf to intervene in the case he cited that there were documents and a review of the documents and videotape by a neurologist in jacksonville it said that terri schiavo might not be in a persistent vegetative state at all now what that means is that the dcf has gone to court seeking to get this heard in court and that is what is before judge greer who is the trial court judge who has been in this case for about seven years and he is expected to rule on that tomorrow night at about about well tomorrow afternoon about noon anderson cooper press conference that florida governor jeb bush had i mean it there ll you got to kind of look at the fine points as you have the doctor he quoted didn t actually physically examine terri schiavo is that correct zarrella that s right he said that she was in a minimal he believed now she was in a minimally conscious state he did not examine her all he did was look at videotapes that he was provided of her and he said that he observed her and he also looked at all of the medical records and he is saying now that she is in a minimally conscious state but that she is not in his opinion pvs of course you know as many neurologists as you hear one side or the other maybe just as many who would say she is pvs but this is what the governor has instructed department of children and families to do to go to court which they have and judge greer again the trial court judge is expected to rule on that tomorrow if he turns them down likely they would continue action through the state level up to the florida supreme court on that anderson cooper ok and the likelihood of the u s supreme court i mean the legal experts we ve been talking to say it s not all that likely that they would probably take up this case but you never know zarrella no you never know but given the swift action by the 11th circuit court this afternoon the full court saying no it is likely that the federal courts the supreme court certainly is would assume that they would side on the behalf of the federal courts and not want to get involved in this case and you know that has been the over the supreme court in the past has ruled on this case and said no they would not hear the case so it s not the first time the florida the u s supreme court has been asked to get involved in this case and in the past one other time they said no cooper all right john zarrella fast moving story difficult one appreciate you bringing us up to date thanks john we re going to have a lot more on the terri schiavo case not only in this hour but also in the coming up in the 8 00 hour we re really going to focus in on the latest developments on that case some new developments however in the minnesota school shootings now we have seen young men and boys kill their classmates before and every time it happens we always search for answers why did they do it were there any warning signs could the murders have been prevented the family of jeff weise is certainly searching for answers as well right now we re joined now in minneapolis by kim desjarlait she is jeff weise s aunt kim thank you very much for being with us i m sorry for all that your family is going through and your community did this just come out of was this just a complete surprise for you kim desjarlait jeff weise s aunt it was it was a complete surprise to me his dad all of us in the minneapolis area it s not the jeff that we knew cooper now you haven t seen jeff for a couple years i think since 2001 his parents got divorced you re the sister of his stepdad what kind of a kid was he i mean when you knew him desjarlait jeff was a good kid he was as far as i knew a very respectable kid he was very good with manners he was a very happy kid he never as far as i knew had any problems in school or with any kids outside of school he had a cooper so the so i mean there have been desjarlait lot of friends cooper reports some of bullying you don t know you haven t heard those you re not you don t can t confirm those desjarlait whatever happened in the red lake area i have no clue what i know of jeff here in the minneapolis area was that he was not a bully he was never bullied and he had friends here he had a lot of friends here cooper there s no denying that he was a boy who lived through an awful lot of tragedy his father committed suicide his mother was in a nursing home she d been in a bad accident he lived with his grandfather what was his home life like desjarlait in the minneapolis area it was a normal type of life every weekend he went to the movies he would have parties at the chuck e cheese s unintelligible cooper and his relationship with his mom i mean i understand there were some issues with her previous to her accident desjarlait they had as far as i knew a good relationship him his stepdad they all had a good relationship he called my brother dad and he called me auntie cooper how is your brother doing in all this i mean he was jeff s stepdad desjarlait my brother was really devastated by it this is something that he would have never seen or expected that would have came out of jeff the jeff that we all knew was a very good kid he as any kid you know would have issues about making a bed you know and he s told do something he always did it you might get some aggression out of it but he was your typical kid at that time he was a very good kid cooper when something like this happens i mean imagine you and probably everyone who knew him just plays every encounter you had with him in your mind over and over kind of looking for any kind of sign and as you ve done that have any signs popped up desjarlait no not at all not when he lived here he again like i say was a great kid and when he got to red lake you start hearing of all of these things that happened to him and that people started seeing and i don t understand cooper well someone with his someone with his name you know was writing messages to a neo nazi web site desjarlait that s surprising to us because that s not jeff i mean jeff when he lived here he was in a interracial school he had you know african american friends he had caucasian friends he had hispanic friends he never was where he segregated his self just to his race he had a variety of friends cooper well unintelligible clearly a lot was going on in this young man s mind kim desjarlait appreciate you being with us to talk about what you know of your nephew thank you very much desjarlait thank you cooper we wanted to take you back now to the scene of the shooting in red lake where 10 people including jeff weise died much shock and many unanswered questions there as you might imagine david mattingly is there begin videotape david mattingly cnn correspondent voice over on and off the red lake reservation people grieve two days after the worst school shooting since columbine and with each passing day there are more questions victoria brun is the sister of the slain security guard derrick brun one of nine people killed by teenager jeff weise victoria brun sister of shooting victim should he have been allowed to be walking on our streets i mean had anybody ever addressed the family situation the was there you know was there more to cause his it had to be a mental illness for him to go walk in there and shoot my brother with a gun right in his heart mattingly many believe the answers remain sequestered within this isolated and guarded native american community while authorities continue to investigate the life of the 16 year old weise those familiar with his upbringing described to cnn years of social and academic problems a young boy who was frequently picked on they say and was not given the attention he badly needed lee cook weise family member and who was he going to talk to his mother was incapacitated his father was dead and probably nobody else that he found around him understood what he was going through or asked for that matter mattingly lee cook is part of weise s extended family an executive director of a state indian resource center he tells us how in recent years weise s father committed suicide during a standoff with police and how his mother suffered severe brain injuries in a traffic accident leaving her in a nursing home weise wound up in the care of relatives most recently the home of his grandmother on the red lake reservation cook if you re not in an environment or used to an environment where somebody s going to come along and say you know maybe it would be appropriate for him to have some kind of counseling or maybe somebody ought to be talking to the son or to the family about the trauma that he s been through and i think a lot of times we just assume people unintelligible a lot of things mattingly instead weise grew angry until his rage took the lives of nine people before he took his own life like his father in conflict with police cook says the family was unaware until approached by investigators of weise s apparent fascination with a neo nazi web site cook you can make some conjecture you think obviously something at school was rubbing him wrong and he didn t know how to deal with it and as kids do in many instances across the country when they sort of reach the limit of what they can tolerate emotionally and psychologically they act out and some just do it more violently than others and in this case in his mind he did i suppose what he thought he needed to do end videotape mattingly tribal leaders say next for the red lake reservation will be an extended period a wake period for the grieving families this is a traditional event normally lasting two full days and nights and everyone has been told in no uncertain terms that these will be very private events anderson cooper david mattingly thanks very much 360 next this young man had called himself a native

maneuvers and a little later remember the story of a father who lost his son in iraq and set a marine vehicle and himself on fire we re going to find out what has happened to him now all that ahead first let s take a look at your picks the most popular stories right now on cnn com commercial break cooper president bush is turning his gaze south of the border with that and other stories making news right now let s check in with erica hill of headline news hey erica erica hill headline news hey anderson good to see you yes president bush and the leaders of canada and mexico announced plans today to strengthen economic and security ties among the countries setting aside some of their regional differences they met in texas to adopt agreements aimed at making north american markets more competitive and they vowed to work more closely to fight terrorism in a rapidly changing world a deadly explosion today at a b p oil refinery in texas city texas tv stations in houston reported four people were killed in the blast as many as 100 others hurt the cause of the explosion isn t yet known federal investigators say last month s plane crash in new jersey s teeterboro airport was caused by improper loading not icing the national transportation safety board says the plane s center of gravity was well forward of the allowable limit twelve people were hurt when the plane ran off the runway as it attempted to take off for chicago and this one you just got to see two alligators eventually wrestled out of a community lake near the florida everglades after neighbors complained to authorities seemed they were going after the pets dozens of residents watched from a nearby street an animal control expert went into the water lassoed the gators taped their mouths shut the larger one was 11 feet long officials say there were rumors it was eying a neighborhood poodle before help arrived get all the cats and dogs inside anderson cooper yikes you know what that gator was doing it was cowboying hill cowboying i knew it exactly cooper all right erica thanks very much we ll see you in 30 minutes hill thanks cooper back to the incident in the minnesota school we may never know what drove this young boy jeff weise to do what he did i mean he was 16 years old police are searching for a motive but they re looking through his entire background including what he may have said in cyberspace using the screen name todesengel which is german for angel of death someone identifying himself as jeff weise left dozens of postings on the web site nazi org here are two of those from march 19 2004 quote i guess i ve always carried a natural admiration for hitler and his ideals and his courage to take on larger nations here s a posting from last april by the way i m being blamed for a threat on the school i attend because someone said they were going to shoot up the school on 4 20 hitler s birthday and just because i claim being a national socialist guess whom they ve pinned well shocking as it may seem a lot of young americans also identify with hitler they embrace a culture of hate and they re doing it with music cnn s rick sanchez goes beyond the headlines for the story begin videotape rick sanchez cnn correspondent voice over this is minnesota 2005 not munich in the 1930s it s a new generation an american generation worshiping the ideals of the nazis to a heavy metal beat it s hate hitler and heavy metal as the man behind the music proudly looks on byron calvert music entrepreneur on phone do you know how many labels i could start with a quarter of a million sanchez from his home in south st paul minnesota ex con byron calvert real name brian cecchini has made it his mission and business to market hate rock he calls it white power music calvert well we sell the survival dude survival the expletive deleted sells itself sanchez and what calvert sells he seems to believe it s in his music in his books and on his on his body on camera are you a devotee of adolf hitler calvert there s a lot of things that he did that was spot on sanchez voice over the label is called panzerfaust in tribute to the nazis the lyrics glorify violence against blacks against hispanics but with a special emphasis on jews on camera let me read to you some of the songs now the jew must pay the bill now it is crystal night once more your race once again burns it sounds pretty violent sounds pretty hateful calvert hey hey hey hey nobody ever said i m not trying to convince everybody that i m a pussy we re not a bunch of pacifists there are angry white kids writing this music there are angry white kids listening to it there is no doubt about that sanchez voice over kids that calvert wants to convert with his music and his web site on camera let me read something from your web site we don t entertain racist kids you write we create them calvert now i obviously see you asked me that like but aren t you concerned that you will make these kids be i am a racist i obviously think that the world would be a better place if there was a lot more racist people sanchez this is where the mood goes from someone s belief no matter how hateful to something most would consider much worse in fact they call it project school yard they are targeting kids maybe your kids by trying to get them hooked on their music voice over students across the country calvert says tens of thousands of them are receiving this cd with music from bands like hate machine and the bully boys calvert it s an outreach effort and it s not really any different than any other company that gives samples of its product to people for example if i have a coffee company and i want to give people samples of my coffee i m not going to give it to my own customers sanchez coffee doesn t come with a message of hate calvert who gives a damn the purpose of that example was as a marketing example sanchez the principal of this west virginian town gave a damn when two people tried to distribute the cds to his students jeff nelson madison middle school we certainly don t appreciate unwanted people coming and trying take advantage of 10 to 14 year olds with hateful propaganda sanchez but that s exactly what calvert and panderfaust are trying to do and when the principal tried to stop it he got this phone call from calvert who then recorded it and put it on his web site calvert i suggest you mind your own expletive deleted business and stop stealing cds from your students but get the expletive deleted out of you sanchez byron they re children would you like it if your kid went to a school and somebody came and gave him this message calvert if i have to make room for homosexuals and hottentots and name it you re going to make room for white kids with rebel flags and white power cds and if you don t like it tough expletive deleted sanchez for all of the music cds that project school yard has distributed it s not clear how many new nazis panzerfaust has created meantime calvert is now in a business dispute with his partner on camera you re having problems with panzerfaust in particular will that mean the demise of the movement calvert of course not no one monkey don t stop no show sanchez voice over the monkey slur is aimed at calvert s partner calvert now wants to cut ties with him because he s part hispanic not pure enough nor white enough for him and the other angry young men who gather in basements like this one surrounded by the sounds and the images of a hateful time a time they want to bring back rick sanchez cnn in south st paul minnesota end videotape cooper well since rick first reported that story brian calvert s web site has been shut down anyone trying to find it will be redirect to another hate filled site we are told coming up next on 360 exhausting all of the appeals the mom and dad of terri schiavo running out of option but still the legal appeals continue maybe all the way to the supreme court we ll talk about that ahead also the president and his brother weighing in should the governor be involved in life and death decisions would do you think we re getting a lot of e mail on this we d love to hear from you a closer look at their personal and political connections to this case we re talking about the president and governor bush also tonight a grieving father set himself and a marine vehicle on fire remember that story we ll find out what has happened to him since it was all caught on tape part of our week long special series and later dealing with memories that just will not go away our 360 m d sanjay gupta on coping with post traumatic stress and do you have some memories that you want to get rid of that you can t interesting look at how the brain really works we re covering all the angles be right back commercial break begin video clip gov jeb bush r florida i m doing everything within my power to make sure terri is afforded at least the same rights that criminals convicted of the most heinous crimes take for granted end video clip cooper that was florida governor jeb bush today making a startling announcement making his position very clear he also said that a new neurologist has examined the case examined terri schiavo and determined that he she is not in a vegetative state and in fact he said he would like the state to take custody of her if they could now as we told you at the top of the show a state judge has agreed to consider new evidence and will decide tomorrow whether to reinsert the feeding tube based on this new neurologist s report the parents are waiting for an answer two very powerful men named bush come to their side here is cnn s senior white house correspondent john king begin videotape john king cnn senior white house correspondent late morning waco texas president bush making it clear if the federal courts don t intervene to save terri schiavo he sees no way he can do more george w bush president of the united states we ll watch the courts make its decisions but we look at all options from the executive branch perspective king oh and by the way g bush i have not discussed the next steps from the brother my brother who is the governor of florida king two and a half hours later tallahassee florida governor jeb bush saying he now believes he has executive authority to at least temporarily restore schiavo s feeding tube j bush we re exhausting all executive options king the role of the brothers bush is a remarkable subplot to the legal and political battle over schiavo and the broader debates over the right to life and the right to die keith appel conservative strategist the congress the president the legislature the governor in florida have all bent over backwards they ve all gone to remarkable lengths certainly unprecedented lengths in my lifetime and the lifetimes of most people to try to save the life of this one woman king for years this was jeb bush s fight in the florida legislature and in the state courts president bush stepped in when it appeared his brother s options at the state levels were exhausted supporting and then rushing back from texas to sign extraordinary legislation shipping the schiavo fight to the federal courts very different in political style the president acknowledges he tends to be blunt his brother is more soft spoken president bush is a devote christian his brother the government a convert to catholic both outspoken in their support for what they call a culture of life opposition to abortion and cloning strict limits on stem cell research and now extraordinary executive efforts in the schiavo case that won praised from social conservatives but run contrary to majority opinion in the united states and critics say contrary to years of legal precedent katherine tucker legal analyst it has been an act that is such a gross overreaching of the bounds of federal authority end videotape king two brothers one the chief executive of florida the other the chief executive of the united states yet their considerable powers perhaps not enough to win a fight they insist is motivated by deep moral beliefs not as some critics say anderson of politics cooper well john that s what s remarkable on camera all these politicians say politics has nothing to do with this but i mean these are politicians don t politics always have something to do with this king well certainly if the motivation itself is not politics there are ramifications in politics and many say that both the president and his brother the governor perhaps going an extra step or at least seeing if they can go an extra step to keep at least keep their political bases happy again unintelligible both men insist if that happens it is secondary and it s accidental if you will coincidental they say they are motivated by their moral beliefs but of course anytime you have a case so controversial so emotional there is a legal fight and there is a very loud political fight cooper john king thanks very much appreciate it michael schiavo getting death threats hires bodyguards for protection tonight has he become a wanted man for trying to end his wife s life and caught on tape a father

protests are getting more emotional and very very personal also later tonight the suspect in jessica lunsford murder was a plea for help missed years ago we ve got the interrogation tapes that tell the tale coming up commercial break cooper images from fighting in falluja the shock the fear the violence of war it is literally unforgettable for so many americans coming home from iraq excuse me excuse me some events our brains simply cannot forget as we continue our series refresh your memory 360 md sanjay gupta shows us how horrible memories can actually change the brain begin videotape esteban lora army national guard there are a lot of things they see every day to day that remind me iraq like for the new years you had to walk outside your door and you see all of these things flying around and you hear the firecrackers popping it s like for a second you re like whoa sanjay gupta cnn medical correspondent voice over esteban lora is 22 years old a college student in miami and a war veteran with a purple heart he battled insurgents in a notorious sunni triangle in the fall of 2003 he was wounded by a roadside bomb and sent home the scars on his hand and foot have healed over but mentally lora i was angry very emotional very emotional gupta a doctor at the miami v a hospital diagnosed with him with post traumatic stress disorder ptsd encompasses a wide range of symptoms nightmares and flashbacks are common a signature complaint is that the smallest stimulus like a noise triggers a flood of painful overwhelming memories it leads to jumpiness anger and depression psychiatrist douglas bremner is at the forefront of scientific research on people with ptsd with advanced imaging technology he and others have been able to pinpoint actual changes in the brain perhaps the biggest difference is in the hippocampus that area so central to memory in people with ptsd it is significantly smaller than in healthy people researcher robert osturer ph put me through a brain scan an mri testing the function of my hippocampus my healthy brain could remember exactly where to go in the water mains but ptsd patients have trouble with this in real life they can have trouble recalling directions or what to buy at the store here s my brain during the task the area s lighting up so brightly are the two sides of the hippocampus but on a ptsd patient the hippocampus isn t lighting up at all there s no focus of activity a damaged hippocampus leads to other problems too severe absentmindedness and intrusive fearful memories today standard treatments for ptsd are anti depressants and group and individual therapy lora s doctors say that by seeking and receiving treatment early on his chance of recovery is excellent research also backs up what several doctors and patients told us social support tends to help as much as anything lora relief came when you re sitting around with the same guys you were with in iraq and saying hey man i m having these problems and you know you open up to them and they re like dude let s get help let s go the most painful thing for me is to sit in a room or go to drill and know that you re among heroes that s my thing it s not painful it s just painful because so joyful i know people who are heroes real life heroes and they re my friends gupta with a wedding planned for june and two years left to a political science degree this hero is putting his life back together he s one of the lucky ones end videotape cooper he certainly is are there certain kinds of memories that are harder for us to forget than others gupta yes yes the sense of smell really very interesting anderson you d think that the most powerful memories would be visual but in fact the smell something goes through your nose and goes almost directly to that area of the brain that s so central for memory so smell can be hard also sounds a lot of veterans say the smell of diesel and the sound of helicopters are unforgettable so those two things even more than visual are hard to forget cooper if you know a smell or sound can trigger bad memory can you change it can you associate it with someone or something else gupta yes you know we looked pretty hard into this the whole notion of replacing a bad memory sort of like if you have a memory of a song that keeps playing over and over again in your head a song that you don t like you can replace that with another song for example or something else if you would like to try to get that one memory out of your mind but it really takes a conscience effort to be able to do it but it s possible cooper i have the macarena song eternally going in my head sanjay gupta thanks very much our series on memory continues tomorrow with deceptive memories how two people can see the same thing and remember it completely differently we see this in the courtroom all of the time u s troops on the offensive in iraq just one of the stories making news at a quarter until the hour erica hill from

principle behind this competition is pretty straightforward you rush in you cast your net you look for the biggest fish and the biggest fish wins oh there is one more thing the water in the river argungu at its deepest point is about seven to eight feet voice over thousands of bobbing heads dip into the muddy waters while other contestants float about on their giant calabashes and lifeguard patrol the river in canoes just in case someone needs help in the suddenly frothing waters of the argungu it s a picture of chaos and confusion exactly an hour after the starting gun and it s all over the prize catches are tagged and laid out for all to see and then the moment of truth a whopping 165 pound nile perch caught by local hero timothy olu so large two men struggle to hold it up to the winner the spoils with his shiny trophy and 1 000 in cash olu walks away or rather drives a way in this brand new minibus which is also now his but perhaps most importantly he carries off bragging rights as nigeria s number one fisherman jeff koinange in northern nigeria end videotape gorani well anderson as well as that minivan and the bragging rights a big fish also means big money for the winner more than 7 000 to be exact and it s a country where people live on less than 1 a day so that s 22 years of cash with one big catch anderson cooper yes how would you like to be a catfish just sitting in argangugu sic waiting for those guys to come gorani you don t have a chance i tell you cooper i believe you all right hala thanks very much 360 next the latest developments in the terri schiavo battle including a doctor s claim tonight that she is not in a vegetative state and it has big political implications we ll tell you about that also later the chilling confession of the man who now stands accused of killing a child commercial break begin video clip g bush this is an extraordinary and sad case and i believe that in a case such as this the legislative branch the executive branch ought to err on the side of life which we have and now we ll watch the courts make its decisions end video clip cooper welcome back to this special two hour edition of 360 we re focusing in depth tonight on the terri schiavo case events moving very fast indeed all day long and even right now here is where things stand right now the 11th u s circuit court of appeals today denied an emergency appeal by ms schiavo s parents to reconsider their daughter s case so that avenue is closed today too the florida state senate failed to pass a specially crafted bill that would have resulted in terri schiavo s feeding tube being reinserted another avenue closed but then late today florida governor jeb bush announced that he is looking for some other way for his state to intervene citing what he called new evidence that the brain damaged 41 year old woman may have been misdiagnosed that she is in fact not in a persistent vegetative state this according to a new neurologist on the case that he had on the case a neurologist who has not actually physically examined terri schiavo so two doors seemingly slammed shut another though suddenly opened a crack late today a ruling a judge said that tomorrow judge greer who has been on this case for years now said that tomorrow he will rule on that allegedly new evidence referred to by governor jeb bush so what should have been the most private of all decisions involving a woman who s been marooned on a hospital bed for years has now today become a debate in the courts and the houses of legislature and out on the streets something more passionate even than that john zarrella has more begin videotape john zarrella cnn miami bureau chief voice over even children attempting to bring water to terri schiavo were put into handcuffs outside her hospice the protest was peaceful and coordinated with police so there would be no violence but it underscores the religious fervor of the people here crowd this day our daily bread zarrella their passionate about their religion and the right to life cause the scene playing out at the hospice is they say not just michael schiavo s doing unidentified male i m not going to point fingers as to who s to specifically to blame but we definitely need a conversion of hearts here in this country to once again uphold the culture of life unidentified female i do believe that we are in a culture of death that we glorify death in this country zarrella fingers were pointed toward at least one of the judges involved in the schiavo case unidentified male he s a wicked man a wicked judge zarrella against this backdrop police presence is everywhere and in numbers for several weeks michael schiavo has been under police guard people close to him say he has received death threats protesters have even staged rallies at schiavo s house unidentified male mr schiavo can we talk to you please zarrella given the level of religious zealotry evident in the debate over schiavo there is reason for concern governor bush today implored people to keep it peaceful gov jeb bush r florida those who value life need to act accordingly even though we may disagree with the courts there is no justification for violent acts zarrella florida has seen it s share of violence by extremists in 1993 michael griffin murdered an abortion doctor in front of a pensacola clinic he s serving a life sentence paul hill one of griffin s supporters took the life of an abortion doctor and his escort the following year he was executed for his crime one of hill s supporters was caught by the fbi at miami beach he was sentenced last year for plotting to blow up abortion clinics a security analyst and former broward sheriff nick navarro says high emotions can lead people to overreact nick navarro former broward county sheriff they could react in a manner that it could be a violent situation at hand so i hope that this security continues for the time being now and maybe even after she expires zarrella the florida department of law enforcement says it is monitoring the situation in pinellas park and in its words quote collecting intelligence while supporters don t agree with the law as it pertains to terri they are being careful not to break it john zarrella cnn pinellas park florida end videotape cooper well on 360 we don t take sides we like to present all the angles in a moment you re going to hear from an adviser to terri schiavo s parents but first brian schiavo the brother of michael schiavo terri s husband who is spearheading the effort to let his wife die i talked with him earlier today begin videotape cooper brian i want to play you something that governor bush said earlier today and have you respond to it let s take a look brian schiavo brother of michael schiavo ok begin video clip bush the neurologist s review indicates that terri may have been misdiagnosed and it is more likely that she is in a state of minimal consciousness rather than in a persistent vegetative state this new information raises serious concerns and warrants immediate action end video clip cooper the governor s saying she s in a minimal conscious state rather than a persistent vegetative state true b schiavo that s what he believes but you know he was asked to come in and take a good look at all of the information the medical information and he wouldn t have had to do this at the last minute to throw this in there and to try to create a problem at the last minute he was asked to look at this before i don t believe that s true i ve been to see her she s very peaceful and she s not conscious she unfortunately this particular condition it looks like somebody s awake they have wake and sleep cycles and it looks like they re awake but terri doesn t recognize anybody she doesn t recognize where she is so i don t agree with that at all cooper so in your opinion she s not aware of any of this whirlwind around her right now b schiavo not at all not at all cooper what is it like in that hospital room i mean i know your brother has been there around the clock except when the feeding tube was removed i mean what is the atmosphere like b schiavo well unfortunately it s you know it s when you walk in i m a little i m a little concerned for you know there s other people there that have loved ones that are dying and i m not sure i don t think that there is a problem but i would imagine i can only imagine if it was me being made to to be privy to all that commotion it wouldn t be a pleasant thing but getting into you know exactly in the room itself it s very peaceful i mean she is just very peaceful there i don t know why people think she you know this quote unquote starving to death is so terrible she is very very peaceful cooper the people who say the feeding tube should be put back in say that people don t treat animals like this they don t allow animals to starve to death your response to that b schiavo no but terri s not an animal first of all and this is her wish she didn t want to be this way she expressed that not only to my brother many people think it s just communication that she expressed to my brother during their marriage but there are other people involved that she had conversations with about this you know i can t equate it to an animal terri s not an animal she s not an object so you know everybody says give her over to her parents well she s not an object unfortunately she s become a political object but she s not an object just to be turned over to somebody and her wishes right now her constitutional rights are being violated i don t care how mr bush or anybody else in congress whether it be in the united states congress or senate you know some of their irrational decision making is very troublesome and people of this country they need to be very very concerned about the people that we put in a position such as tom delay has his behavior is just irrational and next time you go and pull your levers just make sure who we re putting in these positions cooper brian schiavo i appreciate you being with us thank you brian b schiavo no problem at all thank you end videotape cooper well for another angle we go to brother paul o donnell who has been a spiritual adviser to terri schiavo s parents bob and mary schindler i spoke with him earlier as well begin videotape cooper brother o donnell based on these latest decisions today where do you go from here paul o donnell schindler family adviser well i think we re very hopeful that the department of children and families has had a physician examine terri and it has been determined that she is not in a persistent vegetative state cooper well let me just interrupt you for a second because they didn t have a physician actually examine her they had a physician who look at her and then looked at videotapes o donnell right cooper he made it very clear that he didn t examine terri schiavo but go ahead o donnell right but he did go he did go into her room and was at her side and did also physically observe her and so we now believe that the department of children and families can pursue taking terri schiavo into protective custody at least that s what we re hoping for cooper under what jurisdiction under what right do you think that they should be allowed to take physical custody of her as judge after judge has ruled that michael schiavo is within his rights o donnell well it s only judge greer that has refused primarily that the dcf should not get involved but the department of children and families it s a state organization that investigates people who are being abused vulnerable adults children and they do have the authority by florida state law if someone is being physically abused and there is evidence that terri schiavo is not in a persistent vegetative state and therefore what is being done to her now and what the department has found constitutes her being into protective custody cooper there are hundreds of protesters have come forward of course on behalf of the schindlers some of them have been arrested are you in any way encouraging this kind of very active protest o donnell well let me say i understand their frustration this is the united states of america and we re on day six where a human being is being deprived of food and hydration and here in miami i m told that someone is going to prison for five years for starving animals it s insanity what s happening here in florida crosstalk cooper but aren t people taken off feeding tubes all the time o donnell well when they re dying but terri is not dying of any terminal illness she could live another 20 30 40 years she is the only person in the united states that has been court ordered to die in other words judge greer didn t say the guardian may remove the feeding tube judge greer said the guardian shall and that s a very dangerous precedent in the united states cooper we re going to leave it there brother paul o donnell appreciate you being with us thank you o donnell thank you end videotape cooper well as i point out we don t take sides in this program but we are a stickler for facts we looked into the association of brother o donnell s that terri schiavo is legally unique because a court ordered not that her feeding tube could be removed but that it had to be removed we found that brother o donnell is incorrect in this case in at least once case the case of woman a named nancy beth cruzan a court did order that a feeding tube had to be removed begin videotape cooper voice over john couey charged with killing jessica lunsford tonight his tape recorded confession to another crime john evander couey defendant i asked her if she wanted to play hide and go seek cooper was there something more police could have done to keep track of this sexual predator elizabeth smart kidnapped by a deranged man wanting to make her his wife tonight a 360 interview with elizabeth s father ed smart the lesson he s learned and his advice to keep your kids out of the hands of a predator 360 continues end videotape commercial break begin video clip mary schindler mother of terri schiavo when i close my eyes at night all i can see is terri s face in front of me dying starving to death end video clip cooper well that was a statement from mary schindler terri schiavo s mother she s begging for her daughter s life after several setbacks today schiavo s parents are expected to ask the u s supreme court to step in and keep her alive congressional correspondent joe johns is outside the court joins us now hey joe joe johns cnn capitol hill correspondent hey anderson we ve been basically waiting all day for this appeal to the united states supreme court heard about it early this morning but it hasn t gotten here just a little while ago got some information about perhaps why the attorney for the schiavo parents has been busy in tampa on other issues related to this case and only this evening started working on the supreme court appeal meanwhile some others here in washington d c have also been working on this appeal even though it hasn t gotten here yet among them some key house republicans including the speaker of the house himself house majority leader tom delay and the chairman of the house judiciary committee they put together an amicus brief in other words a friend of the court brief as well as a letter of intent to the court to be delivered with the appeal when it is filed they make several points probably key among them we have a graphic is that the court the court below failed to properly assess the legislative history of the acts that was passed over the weekend and signed by the president in the terri schiavo case they say the legislation they passed requires the reinsertion of the feeding tube also that the plain meaning and legislative history require that a temporary restraining order be issued this is required to ensure that desperately needed nutritional support is provided to keep terri schiavo alive during the pendency of her claim now whenever that application for appeal gets here whenever the appeal itself gets here of course it is expected to go first to justice anthony kennedy he has the option of entering a temporary restraining order on his own or bumping this issue up to the high court in its whole in its entirety that is what is expected to happen anderson back to you cooper all right joe live at the supreme court thanks joe regardless of what happens at the supreme court judge greer who s the judge who has been following this case and ruling on it for years said late today he ll review the so called new medical evidence that governor bush spoke about earlier today evidence the governor says indicates terri schiavo is not in a vegetative state there are so many legal angles on the story it s very easy to get confused want to try to clear things up right now with where everyone stands with attorney avery friedman avery good to see you thanks for being on the program avery friedman civil rights attorney nice to see you anderson cooper florida judge george greer has agreed to consider new evidence on what terri schiavo is in fact in a persistent vegetative state is this the best hope right now for schiavo s parents to get that feeding tube back in friedman it s a pretty remote one anderson what the judge is doing and remember this is the same judge that found by clear and convincing evidence that terri schiavo didn t want the feeding tube now is reconsidering new evidence or will consider new evidence based on the department of family and children under an abuse or neglect statute but i think that judge greer is going to be very careful as he has been throughout this case before making a ruling which would reverse the precedent which has been established i think it s very very unlikely we re going to see a change cooper and basically you know we re calling it new evidence but in fact when you look at the details this is one neurologist hired by the state to look at the case friedman right cooper to examine videotapes and to stand in the room with terri schiavo not to even physically examine her so to call it even new evidence you know it s a fine line friedman well it s evidence the question is what weight judge greer is going to give to it and you nailed the point the point is that this new doctor has not examined the patient maybe it would be different but in any event what judge greer is going to consider is whatever weight he s going to assign to this new medical evidence and you know what it s the sign of a good judge judge greer is doing the right thing this issue is so important this case is so remarkable that judge greer is doing the right thing i don t think again it s going to make a whole lot of difference but it really is the last major hook that the schindlers have in this case cooper well what about the u s supreme court what are the chances there friedman well remember joe just gave his report in front of the supreme court i think the schindlers lawyer wasted a lot of time today by trying to convene the entire u s court of appeals for the 11th circuit it was i think a waste of time and i will tell you why anderson the opinion that was issued at 2 15 this morning and i was waiting i got it off the wires basically was very analytical and dealt with the issue of congressional intent what senator frist had to say what senator levin had to say very well written and so we knew that it was a powerful opinion instead of going to the supreme court which if the schindlers were represented by me that s exactly where i would have gone tried to get u s associate justice kennedy to take the case they wasted literally an entire day cooper all right we ll see what happens there at the supreme court tonight and tomorrow avery friedman thanks for joining us appreciate it friedman nice to be with you cooper we re going to take a look at the medical angle on this story and there are so many developments on this story moving very fast we re trying to keep you up to date we re going to take a look at the medical angle really is this new evidence what does it really mean that in a moment but first let s take a look at the other headlines making news right now erica hill from headline news joins us for that hey erica hill hi anderson the army secretary is hoping that by putting an emphasis on patriotism that will inspire parents to get their kids to join up the army is revamping its sales pitch to try to counter sagging recruiting numbers with long deployments overseas the numbers are steadily dropping officials expect they won t meet recruitment goals this month or the next the government is investigating whether millions of ford pickup trucks and suvs may have a potential fire hazard now the probe covers 3 7 million ford f 150 pickups expeditions and lincoln navigators the model years date from the late 90s to early 2000 ford has received 218 complaints of engine fires caused by the cruise control switch pop singer whitney houston has checked into rehab again no other details are available at this point houston last checked herself into a rehabilitation center a year ago this after denying she used drugs for years she admitted using cocaine marijuana and pills in a tv interview in 2002 houston said she was using the power of prayer now to help her get over her addiction and that s the latest from headline news anderson cooper all right erica thanks we ll see you again in about 30 minutes for another update right next coming up next on 360 what about this new medical evidence is terri schiavo not in a vegetative state 360 m d sanjay gupta weighs in next and a little later tonight the man accused of killing little jessica lunsford confessed to another crime in the past we have the tapes we re going to play it it raises some alarming questions we ll be right back commercial break begin video clip j bush the neurologist s review indicates that terri may have been misdiagnosed and it is more likely that she is in a state of minimal consciousness rather than in a persistent vegetative state end video clip cooper well with that announcement florida governor jeb bush said the state has filed another request to intervene to keep terri schiavo alive he s basically saying she s been misdiagnosed now a state judge who ordered the feeding tube removed says he s going to rule on that case by noon tomorrow 360 m d sanjay gupta joins me now for a look at this is that possible i mean what s the difference between a state of minimal consciousness and a persistent vegetative state dr sanjay gupta cnn medical correspondent there are several differences actually between the two and it can be difficult for anybody even a neurologist to sometimes distinguish a couple of things a persistent vegetative state as we ve seen so many times now a person can have sleep wake cycles they actually open their eyes and close their eyes they sometimes do not consciously process pain their eyes can open spontaneously they don t have any evidence of the following perception of surroundings ability to communicate or any intended movements everything is more reflex compare that to a minimally conscious state the biggest most cardinal difference between the two is that they can actually follow some sort of commands their eyes open spontaneously they have the sleep wake cycles those are all the same they can feel pain but they demonstrate some awareness of their environment the biggest thing though and i have not see any evidence of this in the videotapes is that if you told them to do a simple thing like hold up two fingers or wiggle your thumb or turn your head to the right they would actually hear you and follow a command you know obviously from the videotape that we see it s hard to get a sense of that but those are sort of the big differences between the two cooper that s fascinating so they would follow a simple command they would give yes or no responses they would verbalize the doctor who made that diagnosis that the governor is basing all this on he s a neurologist at the mayo clinic in jacksonville he wasn t he didn t personally examine terri schiavo he looked at videotapes which we ve all seen he reviewed her medical records he stood in the room and saw her but he didn t touch her is that important does that matter gupta stood in the room he met her but didn t examine her yes it is important i think that this is the type of situation where you need to have a thorough exam to be able to tell i think it s really impossible to tell based on the videotapes alone i mean i think that that s pretty clear a lot of people are making a lot of comments about these videotapes we re seeing you know just a few minutes out of 15 years that a person has been in this state if someone is saying that she s in fact in a minimally conscious state it would be great to see a videotape of her actually following a command that is so crucially important anderson obviously she s opening her eyes closing her eyes maybe even having some reflexes in terms of smiling grimacing things like that but if she actually follows a command it says that she can hear she can understand and she can act upon that information critical information anderson cooper yes and this has been in the court for seven years now the judge who s been ruling on this all along is going to rule on this very matter tomorrow so we ll be watching that very closely by noon tomorrow we re told sanjay gupta thanks appreciate it gupta thank you yes cooper we re going to continue to follow this story if anything happens in the next half hour we ll let you know but we want to bring you up to date on the case of little jessica lunsford in particular the man accused of killing her in a moment you re going to hear confession tapes from the alleged killer confessing to another crime years ago the question is was there something more police or prison officials or somebody could have done we re going to take a look at the tapes and what can you do to protect your kids a 360 interview with ed smart whose daughter elizabeth there was kidnapped and found alive we ll also update you on her case and later the long search for a fugitive is over after 20 years on the lam the law finally got their man commercial break cooper new details are emerging about john couey he s the man accused of abducting sexually assaulting and killing jessica lunsford she was a 9 year old girl who disappeared exactly one month ago her body was found last saturday now couey has a very long rap sheet back in 1991 he was arrested for molesting a child and back then he confessed to police cnn has obtained a copy of the tape of couey s 1991 confession it raises some pretty alarming questions about whether something more could have been done to stop this guy heidi collins takes us beyond the headlines hey heidi heidi collins cnn correspondent hey anderson you know if we could only turn the clock back to 1991 when john couey made it clear he had a problem that prison could not cure listen now to his confession to police 14 years ago about what he did to a 5 year old girl in her back yard on this audiotape begin videotape john couey convicted sex offender she was riding across and i went over there and she offered to go into the back yard to jump on the trampoline and i said ok so we went back there and she was jumping on there and i asked if she wanted to play hide and go seek and she said yes so we did collins voice over it gets worse couey acknowledges to the officer that he exposed himself that the girl then sat on his lap voluntarily he claims and then he put the girl s hand on him there s more we ll spare you the details couey then her mother come out and yelled for her and i took off i feel that prison ain t going to help well i d got out in three years i got a ten year sentence and it doesn t really help i feel that i need help for myself and that s why i m confessing you know to my crime that i committed tonight because i want help for myself so i will never have to do this again i feel bad about it really i do i don t want to go to prison i just want to get help for myself so that s what i need i want help for myself collins couey was given the maximum sentence for attempted molestation five years and was out on parole in two he was honest enough with himself and with police at the time to admit that his effort to molest a young girl was not a one time event a written report by the officer who took the taped confession says quote couey admitted that this was not the first child he had ever touched however this is the first time he was caught the officer continues couey admitted to molesting his wife s daughter however she agreed not to report the incident if he left the house and gave her a divorce which he did couey knows he has a problem however he has never sought medical assistance to help him control his sexual attraction for young children end videotape collins we should also let you know that we tried unsuccessfully to locate couey s former wife for comment on this so 14 years after john couey s plea for help 14 years after he was caught attempting to molest a child and at least seven arrests later john couey now stands accused of kidnapping sexually assaulting and killing 9 year old jessica lunsford if convicted any help he may now get is obviously too late for him and too late for jessica lunsford cooper certainly is heidi collins thanks very much trying to understand what exactly goes on inside the mind of a molester it s a hard thing to do but we think it s important not only for police but for parents earlier i spoke to james goldenflame who did five years in prison for molesting his own daughter in the 1980s he s not re offended he says since that time and has written a book called overcoming sexual terrorism i started by asking him if prison can actually do any help to reform sex offenders begin videotape james goldenflame author overcoming sexual terrorism yes it can to begin with and we must not overlook this the first thing is does is help keep the community safe while the person is inside prison obviously but there s a second additional help that imprisonment gives us when the crime of the kind that s occurred here involving this little child takes place the community has a right to express its wrath and prison is the way we do it in our system we say we are so angry at you we re putting you in a place of punishment so it helps there as far as the inmate is concerned it gives him a place where if he uses his time productively and wisely and if he s in the right kind of state system where it s available he can get help while he s there that s what happened to me i was sent to prison on a 10 year sentence and while i was there i sought and i was fortunate to be able to receive help so that during the entire time that i was there and i served slightly over half my sentence before being released i had help and counseling and therapy throughout and it prepared me to come out and be able to have a re offense free life all of these years since cooper but there is no cure as you have goldenflame no no but you know anderson it s like this there s no cure for a lot of mental problems there s no cure for schizophrenia or manic depressiveness or bipolar and again and again what we get instead is no there s no cure but you can manage these so you don t become a schizophrenic or a bipolar cooper so you manage it and yet i mean we see people doing this over again they say they re not going to i know the figures maybe aren t as high as some people think the recidivism rates but they are alarmingly high and in a lot of these cases we never find out about are people just manipulating the system are sexual predators i mean a lot of times do they know what the therapist wants them to say and they re repeating it goldenflame it won t work anymore anderson there s a new technological device out now called the plethysmograph another variation of it was pioneered by dr gene able in atlanta and in both cases it s like a sexual lie defector that is used on us that we can t fake out it ll show whether there s any active deviancy left or not it ll actually track it and graph it and they can see what s going on in your brain cooper but i mean in order to molest kids you have to be a master manipulator goldenflame yes this is true and as a result when conventional psychotherapy was tried years ago it didn t work we came in we conned the system we conned sometimes the therapists and we as a result we remained no better than we were before except maybe we learned a little about psychology cooper what changes do we need to make goldenflame we need to make sure that everybody who goes to prison for a sex offense has treatment made available to them from day one and they re not let out until their treatment team says yes we can see he s safe for supervised release we need to have them in on a life sentence so if they get out on a supervised release and they even begin to look funny they can go right back in for the rest of their life sentence cooper just finally for parents advice for how to keep their kids safe goldenflame look up and see who the sex offenders are if there are any in your neighborhood use megan s law for a start and secondly if you put your child in a youth organization make absolutely certain the organization has a standing rule that no child is left never left alone with a single adult there s always two adults or more present that way your child has a chance of being safe cooper jake goldenflame appreciate you being with us thanks jake end videotape cooper on camera coming up a man who helps parents cope with a nightmare he knows all too well elizabeth smart was abducted in 2002 she was found alive her father ed talks about the ordeal and what lessons parents can learn from it also ahead his neighbor says he was a regular guy a church goer a poet he was also a criminal on the run and a little later the latest on the schiavo case and your e mails go to cnn com 360 click on the instant feedback link we d love to hear from you commercial break cooper every parent of course wants to know what they can do to protect their child from illness from accidents and from sexual predators ed smart s daughter elizabeth was abducted in june of 2002 she remained missing for nearly a year she was found alive returned home in march of 2003 he ed smart has learned so much about sexual predators and what parents can do to protect their kids i spoke with him earlier begin videotape cooper were you you really had your eyes opened were you stunned at once you started looking into this at how common it was ed smart daughter was kidnapped i was the thing that i was so overcome with was i never thought this could happen to me i never thought it would happen to our family and we never pictured ourselves being in that position and when that happened that morning of june 5 i just i thought you know my gosh you know what is it these families go through and what kind of pain and residual issues did they deal with cooper are these kind of kidnappings like we just saw in florida are they preventable smart well i think that legislatively we can do a lot i mean right now the national sex offender registry is in very poor shape it s very ineffective about 46 to 48 out of the 50 states consider non registration of the sex offender to be a misdemeanor versus a felony cooper and if you do find out that there is a sexual predator living in your neighborhood or several i mean we ve again getting e mails from several people that said you know i went online last night and found out there are 10 people in my neighborhood what can you do about it smart you can decide where your children are going to go they don t need to go near that home they can go out of their way i think that you can you know say you know you just can t go out there by yourself i think the statistics are that there is one within every square mile throughout the united states so there is there s an issue there that we need to face as a nation that one they ve always been there i mean maybe it s more predominant now but they ve always been there but we have never known that they were and now it s coming online so that you can find out where they are and i think that you can protect your children by knowing where where the predator is but it s being aware of it cooper it s a tough conversation to have with your child smart there s no question about it but i think the important thing is i mean with all of the awareness that s come up about kidnappings it s an easy way to get your children scared and the way to get rid of that you know scared type of being is basically by preparing them there s a program that i ve been working with called rad kids that is an empowerment tool that you know in grade schools in salt lake they ve well in provo they ve started to implement it into the school p e program where they actually teach the children you know starting with 911 you know they talk about who you can trust out there they actually go through the motions of not just telling but teaching they ll go through you know use your elbow do this take three giant steps back and it s an eight hour course that they actually go through during the year and i believe that it empowers them it gives them options cooper ed smart thanks for being with us smart thank you end videotape cooper well a blast in an oil refinery claims more than a dozen lives erica hill from headline news has an update right now hey erica erica hill headline news yes and still a lot of questions surrounding this one anderson a deadly explosion today at a bp oil refinery in texas texas city texas that is at least 14 people were killed in the blast as many as 70 others hurt it blew out windows miles away but the cause still not known president bush and the leaders of canada and mexico today announced plans to strengthen economic and security ties among the countries setting aside some of their regional differences they met in texas to adopt agreements aimed at making north american markets more competitive and they vowed to work more closely to fight terrorism in a rapidly changing world it is not exactly an amber alert but more of a burnt orange alert in the houston

where it was stolen the vehicle was a gift to the rocket for his 300th win he got it from the yankees he s offering a 10 000 reward for its safe return and you know something similar happened to me in

lam for 20 years after his escape from prison he s finally caught it s one of the most viewed stories on cnn com all day three sixty s rudi bakhtiar joins us she looks into these web sites and brings you angles you won t see anywhere else what did you find out about the guy rudy bakhtiar cnn correspondent well this one was a very interesting one we found enough to make anybody wonder anderson how well do you really know the people you work with or socialize with for that matter well thanks to a lot of persistence by police and some important high tech help one man s past has just caught up with him begin videotape bakhtiar voice over in chicago the people at this unitarian church thought they knew j j jameson well enough he was a poet an antiwar protester but under a different name he was also an escaped double murderer det lt kevin horton massachusetts state police don t let anyone kid you he s a cold blooded killer bakhtiar j j jameson is actually norman porter who had done 26 years of a life sentence in massachusetts before escaping in 1985 question had you ever given up horton yes no no i mean did we work on it every day no but did we ever forget about the case no bakhtiar porter was captured on tuesday thanks to computers the fbi s fingerprint database matched porter s prints to prints taken when jameson was arrested in chicago back in 1993 but wait a minute that was 12 years ago so why did it take so long horton it could have been misread if it was misread they don t catch it in the old days it was all hand done people did it it s all automated now my guess is it was it wasn t done correctly at first then with the new automation they ran everything again and it popped up that way that s my guess bakhtiar it s another success story for the fbi s integrated automated fingerprint identification system iafis for short it s the largest biometric database in the world containing the fingerprints and corresponding criminal records of more than 47 million people but believe it or not this high tech tool for catching criminals has only been operational since 1999 end videotape bakhtiar and even more surprising is that in this age of terrorism u s border patrol is still working on getting all u s ports of entry hooked up to the fingerprint databases and they re hoping to do that by the end of this year cooper so what happened to the guy today he s in custody bakhtiar yes he went to court he waived extradition he s going to be taken back to massachusetts and he said when his captors caught him that it s been a good 20 years cooper no doubt all right rudi bakhtiar thanks for that even more surprising we have a lot more ahead of you ahead of us we have about eight minutes until larry king coming up next we ve got a lot of viewer e mail to

feedback link and finally tonight taking answered prayers to the nth degree there was a time people didn t have to make the kind of terrible decisions those around terri schiavo are currently being forced to make that is not because things were better then it s because things were worse much worse for most of human history someone too ill or too injured to eat would die it was as simple as that as for terri schiavo s heart and lungs they re functioning on their own but if they weren t there are machines now that could pump blood and breathe for her here too for most of human history a ruined heart or ruined lungs always before simply meant the end no choice about it but now there are choices so many choices so many things that were death sentences once now aren t that is great and enormous and that is progress only it comes with the terrible complication the creation sometimes of a state that is between life and death a mysterious fog bound condition that is not fully the former but not really the latter either that is a kind of hovering as we say things were not better when people didn t have to make such awful decisions not by a long shot nonetheless the decisions still are agonizing thanks very much for watching this special edition of 360 paula zahn continues on vacation we ll be back tomorrow with another two hour version of 360 i m anderson cooper cnn s
