policies in capital tribune news servicenew delhi may 20 the chairman and managing director of housing and urban development corporation hudco dr p s rana said that unlocking just 12 per cent of delhi s land and putting it to intelligent use was enough to take care of as much as six crore 60 million population delhi s current population is close to 22 million delhi s development through proper planning will also put an end to artificial commercial and residential land shortage that has gripped the capital resulting in exorbitant property price escalation in the ncr addressing a conference mr rana who was also member of tejinder khanna committee and senior vice president of indian building congress pointed that delhi was the first city in the country to have a master plan way back in 1961 there has been subsequent master plans latest one is delhi master plan 1991 but non implementation or rather piece meal implementation of the plans led to only 16 per cent of allotted land for commercial usage being developed leaving a huge gap of 84 per cent  this led to major shortage in commercial land availability and forced people to start commercial operations from residential premises the only beneficiary of this situation has been property agents and profiteers he added mr rana said that problem of delhi has been compounded due to existence of monopolistic supplier of land the dda he suggested that policy making and execution should be separated he said that if competition is ushered in the property market in the true sense of the term delhi would see a dramatic fall in property prices as well as easy availability of houses and commercial premises if right policy decisions are taken availability as well as buying and selling of property will be as easy as buying a car he said mr rana pointed out that with the right mix of policies we can easily see commercial rates falling below residential rates as is common in countries with rational land use policies mr k k kapila vice president of indian building congress said that given a choice citizens would avoid messing up with the law and would opt for peace of mind but when they are faced with existential choices they are forced to violate the law he said that this can easily be overcome by modifying current land use laws and regulations in a practical manner while balancing environmental and social sensibilities he added that current land use laws were discriminatory against certain professionals like lawyers architects engineers etc nine held for illegal sand mining in dadri our
