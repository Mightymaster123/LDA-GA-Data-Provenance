tribune news servicegurgaon may 8 the chief information commissioner cic of india mr wajahat habibullah expressed concern here that the union government was slow in fulfilling the duties enjoined upon it by the right to information act 2005 while making a presentation at the prestigious management development institute mdi here on the act and on the obligation and responsibilities on the part of all concerned under it mr habibullah said the government had been enjoined by section 26 to encourage the authorities to participate in the programme aimed at increasing awareness about the whole gamut of issues relating to the act also it is to promote timely and effective dissemination of accurate information on the range of its activities making out a strong case for mass awareness on the right to information and the act per se he lamented that the government was found shortchanging on this front at one point of his presentation he observed that participatory democracy entailed that the public has timely and accurate information he was making the presentation during an interactive session with the public on the act organised jointly by the phd chamber of commerce and industry phdcci and the gurgaon chamber of chamber of commerce and industry gcci he said that at present eight countries in the world including the usa and the uk had acts relating to freedom of information while such laws came into existence in the usa in 1966 it came into existence in the uk in 2000 however the law in uk got into effect only from january 2005 hence the law on right to information in india is not far behind the most progressive countries rather in terms of content it is most modern and forward looking than the law on the subject in other countries he added he cited the case in indian law which allows the public to ask for samples of materials used in construction of roads he added expounding on public interest which has always been cited as an excuse by the authorities to withhold information from the public he said the concept had not been defined and it would be for the national commission on the right to information to define it he clarified that the controversy on whether the notings on official files would be under the purview of the right to information had been settled in favour of the general public the act made it very clear he asserted he further said any public authority including the judiciary and private organisations which had to part with information to the governmental authorities fell under the purview of the act even the supreme court had accepted the judiciary falling within the purview of the act he added he said the national commission had so far received about 800 complaints and has disposed of more than 200 of them speaking on the occasion the former president of the phdcci and founder president of the gcci mr p k jain hoped the act would go a long way in further strengthening the roots of democracy and ensuring transparency in

forecast a further drop in mercury to 40 degree celsius tomorrow with light showers even thereafter the weather conditions would remain comfortable with the mercury expected to hover around the 41 or

up the much hyped special economic zone sez here in favour of a joint venture between the private firm and haryana industrial development corporation government circles are now busy clearing the decks for commencing work on it at an early date the managing director of hsidc mr rajeev arora who was here as chief guest at the 3rd annual general meeting agm of the imt industrial association said the first phase of the joint venture would begin on 1 500 acres of land in garhi harsaru a few kilometres from here according to him the hsidc is waiting for the memorandum of understanding on the project with the reliance group he said the expansion of work on the joint venture project would be carried forward as and when land is acquired for it the sez will start from garhi harsaru in gurgaon district and stretch all the way to jhajjar district vide badli he said the hsidc would ensure that a captive power plant was set up in the proposed sez on 150 acres of land an arrangement would be made with the reliance group that the power generated from it is shared with the industrial estate of imt manesar in the interest of the units there in response to a demand from the imt industrial association he dropped broad hints of amending the law emp 2005 which made it mandatory for industrial plot holders to set up and run their business project production on their plots for at least one year before leasing the premises to other industries the association felt this norm obliged small entrepreneurs who wished to operate from imt manesar to move to other industrial areas of surrounding states since the rates of industrial plots in and around gurgaon are high mr arora said the law would complete one year of existence in june july after which the hsidc may recommend amendment to it however he said the rationale behind the law was to prevent speculative cornering of industrial plots and ensure that only genuine entrepreneurs got them he further said the hsidc for the first time would set up a dormitory for 400 persons and also 192 one room tenements as part of the government labour housing scheme the provision for it was made in the 2006 07 annual budget of the state already

fighting measures only on paper say firemen nalini ranjannew delhi may 8 at a time when emphasis is being given to strengthening fire fighting measures in the city particularly due to the scorching summer heat it is strange that there is a complete lack of such preventive measures at most of the 30 power grid sub stations run by the bses in the trans yamuna area even as the bses runs its own fire fighting system as it claims it is not capable of controlling major fires at these power sub stations such limitations were exposed when a major fire broke out in a power grid sub station in laxmi nagar area last year according to sources of the 30 power stations there are 16 with a capacity of 66 kw and 14 with a capacity of 33 kw the 66 kw power stations are located at dallupura

shahdara gt road etc  apart from the movement of its employees local people come here in masses and stage protest and agitation here these activities certainly breech the fire proof status as claimed by the bses of these power stations cum offices he said another senior officer of the dfs said that the bses fire fighting measures were only on paper a power grid sub station cannot be converted into

the mcd informed the delhi high court today in an affidavit filed before the division bench of acting chief justice vijender jain and justice s n agarwal the mcd said 15 farmhouses each were sealed at najafargarh and narela while two each were sealed in south delhi and civil lines area according to the mcd 111 farmhouses which fulfilled the norm of having a minimum of 60 feet approach road were being allowed to conduct marriage and other official functions the mcd filed the affidavit in response to the court s directive during the last hearing after the civic body and the dda both claimed that not a single farmhouse which did not comply with the minimum layout plan was being allowed to operate in the city the bench while taking on record the affidavit asked the deputy commissioner to examine the petition filed by a farmhouse owner at vijaynagar who complained that he was served with a sealing notice by the mcd despite complying with all the norms according to the petitioner the farmhouse was located outside the peripheries of the residential colonies and also had 3 000 square yards of parking space to accommodate 200 cars at a time the bench had in november last year asked the mcd and the dda to close down all unauthorised farmhouses in the capital and its outskirts as they were causing severe traffic jams and inconvenience to the general public at one stage the high

teachers syed ali ahmed tribune news servicenew delhi may 8 expensive computers purchased by the delhi education department and installed in over 400 schools run by delhi government are gathering dust for the last one year as there are no computer teachers in most of the schools computer education is compulsory for the students of senior secondary classes the delhi government runs a total of 1 132 schools out of which computers were installed in 432 schools at a cost of rs 686 lakhs but ironically there are no teachers to utilise them as a result students are forced to go to private institutes to learn about computers what is even more intriguing is the revelation by a senior official of the education department that there were no plans to appoint computer teachers in the near future according to sources a private company which was given the contract to install the computers and also help in teaching students left the scene suddenly for some reason leaving the government burdened with thousands of computers worth lakhs of rupees what is also intriguing is the fact that no senior officer of the education department of the delhi government was willing to comment on the issue most of the senior officials when contacted passed on the buck to some other officials meanwhile thousands of students who were promised computer education are now left in the lurch with little hope
