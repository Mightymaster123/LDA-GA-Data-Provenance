organized by penguin india at the habitat center new delhi sen s extremely thought provoking work is almost utopian in its expression favouring a perfect multicultural global order based on humanism and tolerance while introducing his book sen says the hope for harmony in the contemporary world lies in the understanding of pluralities in human history he stresses that there is a need to reflect

mute witness to the hindu muslim riots that broke out in the 1947 in india the author also referred to terrorism september 11 bombings in britain and the chaos created by violence today the world over
