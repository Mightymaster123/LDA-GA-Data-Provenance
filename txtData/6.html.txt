Massey Energyâ€™s Negligence Led to Mine Blast, Study Finds - The New York Times
advertisementby sabrina tavernisemay 19 2011washington in the first comprehensive state report on the 2010 coal mine disaster in west virginia an independent team of investigators has put the blame squarely on the owner of the mine massey energy concluding that it had made life difficult for miners who tried to address safety and built a culture in which wrongdoing became acceptable the report released on thursday by an independent team appointed by former gov joe manchin iii of west virginia and led by j davitt mcateer a former federal mine safety chief echoed preliminary findings by federal officials that the blast could have been prevented if massey had observed minimal safety standards but it was more pointed in naming massey as the culprit using blunt language to describe what it said was a pattern of negligence that ultimately led to the deaths of 29 miners on april 5 2010 in the worst american mining disaster in 40 years  the story of upper big branch is a cautionary tale of hubris the report concluded a company that was a towering presence in the appalachian coal fields operated its mines in a profoundly reckless manner and 29 coal miners paid with their lives for the corporate risk taking advertisementin a statement on thursday massey energy s general counsel shane harvey disputed some of the report s findings seventeen company executives refused to be interviewed a choice mr mcateer called most unfortunate advertisementfor people in the industry the report was surprisingly direct  it was very hard hitting said tony oppegard a lawyer who represents miners and their families it talked about political pressures and things you don t typically see in accident reports the 120 page report offered a scathing indictment of massey practices at the upper big branch mine pieced together through months of interviews and the analysis of documents data and correspondence workers at the mine knew that conditions were bad and the report opens with a passage about one miner s fears the day before he died in the disaster  man they got us up there mining and we ain t got no air the miner gary wayne quarles told a friend who talked to investigators i m just scared to death to go to work because i m just scared to death something bad is going to happen the report goes on to say that a perfect storm was brewing inside the mine of poor ventilation equipment whose safety mechanisms were not functioning and combustible coal dust behaving like a line of gunpowder carrying the blast forward in multiple directions investigators flatly rejected the conclusion offered by massey officials that the explosion occurred because a giant burst of methane bubbled from the ground an event that would have been impossible to predict or control the evidence contradicting that theory included the bodies of the miners found near the main explosion only two had methane in their lungs advertisement if as massey investigators maintained one million cubic feet of methane had been suddenly released the result would have been a five million cubic foot flame the report said the evidence does not suggest a force of this magnitude the report stated that explosive coal dust which had been allowed to accumulate carried the blast through the mine killing miners who were far from the original explosion mr harvey the massey general counsel disputed that  we disagree with davitt s conclusion that this was an explosion fueled by coal dust he said again we believe that the explosion was caused by a massive inundation of methane rich natural gas please

reducing the amount of coal dust several times a day the report said instead there were just two who were often diverted to construction projects what is more the machine designed to dilute coal dust a track duster was often clogged and miners were reduced to carrying rock dust the diluting substance into the mine by hand when one of the dusters nathaniel jeter complained to senior management that the machine was broken the response he said spoke volumes about the attitude toward safety track duster i didn t know we had a track duster another area of negligence the report noted was the mine s jury rigged ventilation system cited for 64 violations during 2009 joe mackowiak a ventilation supervisor for the mining safety and health administration who was quoted in the report said that management used a band aid approach making minor adjustments in order to pass inspections the lack of air in the nearly three miles of tunnels combined with coal dust and fumes tormented the miners the report said one miner dean jones would come home so exhausted that the report quoted his wife as saying i d look over at the dinner table and he would be asleep  it literally felt like you were melting said michael ellison a roof bolter who called in sick the day of the accident shortly into the shift he said all of us looked like we had been standing out in a rainstorm just soaking wet miners who tried to remedy the situation were punished when mr jones shut down his section for lack of air a company boss chris blanchard called the dispatcher and told him to tell dean if he didn t get the section running in so many minutes he d be fired the report said mr jones afraid for his job complied advertisementas the largest coal producer in appalachia at the time massey used its leverage to attempt to control west virginia s political system and through it oversight agencies inspectors whose job it was to protect miner safety were cast as enemies the report said with the company challenging their very legitimacy politicians were afraid of the company the report said because the chief executive at the time don blankenship was willing to spend vast amounts of money to influence elections the report said it also faulted regulators for stopping short of applying the strictest censure of massey though it noted that individual regulators like mr mackowiak made every effort to stop dangerous practices massey s allegations that the ventilation problems were the mining administration s fault were baseless the report said the department of labor solicitor m patricia smith said the agency was using new tools to go after violators massey is in the process of being acquired by another company alpha natural resources which has said it plans on retraining massey employees after taking over in june it has also hired christopher adkins a chief operating officer for massey whose role in the disaster was strongly criticized in the report mr adkins was among those who refused to be interviewed and in a briefing with reporters in beckley w va mr mcateer called alpha s choice very discouraging ted pile a spokesman for alpha said mr adkins will not have any role in making operational decisions at the mine level and his job would be in business development far from the safety chain of command a version of this article appears in print on may 20 2011 on page
