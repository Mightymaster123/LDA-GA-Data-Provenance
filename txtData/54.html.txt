Rolling with Ruby on Rails - O'Reilly Media
your accounteditor s note curt hibbs and bill walton have updated this tutorial for rails 1 2 in rolling with ruby on rails revisited and rolling with ruby on rails revisited part two we recommend those tutorials for all new rails development also check out bill walton s monthly series cookin with ruby on rails maybe you ve heard about ruby on rails the super productive new way to develop web applications and you d like to give it a try but you don t know anything about ruby or rails this article steps through the development of a web application using rails it won t teach you how to program in ruby but if you already know another object oriented programming language you should have no problem following along and at the end you can find links on learning ruby let s answer a couple of burning questions before rolling up our sleeves to build a web application ruby is a pure object oriented programming language with a super clean syntax that makes programming elegant and fun ruby successfully combines smalltalk s conceptual elegance python s ease of use and learning and perl s pragmatism ruby originated in japan in the early 1990s and has started to become popular worldwide in the past few years as more english language books and documentation have become available rails is an open source ruby framework for developing database backed web applications what s special about that there are dozens of frameworks out there and most of them have been around much longer than rails why should you care about yet another framework what would you think if i told you that you could develop a web application at least ten times faster with rails than you could with a typical java framework you can without making any sacrifices in the quality of your application how is this possible part of the answer is in the ruby programming language many things that are very simple to do in ruby are not even possible in most other languages rails takes full advantage of this the rest of the answer is in two of rail s guiding principles less software and convention over configuration less software means you write fewer lines of code to implement your application keeping your code small means faster development and fewer bugs which makes your code easier to understand maintain and enhance very shortly you will see how rails cuts your code burden convention over configuration means an end to verbose xml configuration files there aren t any in rails instead of configuration files a rails application uses a few simple programming conventions that allow it to figure out everything through reflection and discovery your application code and your running database already contain everything that rails needs to know we developers often hear the excessive hype that always seems to accompany something new i can just imagine that skeptical look on your face as you hear my dubious claims ten times faster development indeed editor s note bill walton has ported this tutorial to rolling with ruby on instantrails for a very quick installation experience i m not asking you to accept this on blind faith i ll show you how to prove it to yourself first i ll install the needed software then i will lead you through the development of a web application we ll develop this web application on windows you can still follow along if you use a linux or macintosh system but your screen will look different from the screen shots shown below and you will have to install software packages built specifically for your system see the resources section at end of this article for additional software links to develop this web application install the following software figure 1 ruby windows installerinstalling ruby couldn t be any simpler note to linux and os x users the windows installer come with the rubygems package manager already installed whatever means you use to install ruby you will probably have to install rubygems also figure 2 installing rails through rubygemsnow we can use the rubygems package manager to download and install rails 0 9 4 the version covered by this tutorial as figure 2 shows figure 3 mysql server setup wizardwe still need to install our database server rails supports many different databases we ll use mysql figure 4 mysql configuration wizardauthor s note mysql front is not longer available heidisql is a good open source equivalent mysql front is a graphical interface for the mysql database it is an inexpensive commercial application but you can try it for free for 30 days in this article we will use mysql front to develop our database if you prefer you can also just send sql commands to the database from the command line figure 5 mysql front installeressential readingbuilding tag clouds in perl and php by jim bumgardnertag clouds are everywhere on the web these days first popularized by the web sites flickr technorati and del icio us these amorphous clumps of words now appear on a slew of web sites as visual evidence of their membership in the elite corps of web 2 0 this pdf analyzes what is and isn t a tag cloud offers design tips for using them effectively and then goes on to show how to collect tags and display them in the tag cloud format scripts are provided in perl and php yes some have said tag clouds are a fad but as you will see tag clouds when used properly have real merits more importantly the skills you learn in making your own tag clouds enable you to make other interesting kinds of interfaces that will outlast the mercurial fads of this year or the next pages 1 2 3 4 5next page 2018 o reilly
