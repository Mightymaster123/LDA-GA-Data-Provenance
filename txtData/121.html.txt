thousands of his countrymen who fled into exile he became an object of intense hatred castro clung to a socialist economic model and one party communist rule even after the soviet union disintegrated and most of the rest of the world concluded that state socialism was a bankrupt idea whose time had come and gone  the most vulnerable part of his persona as a politician is precisely his continued defense of a totalitarian model that is the main cause of the hardships the misery and the unhappiness of the cuban people said elizardo sanchez a human rights advocate and critic of the castro regime and yet his defenders in cuba point to what they see as social progress made under castro s revolution including racial integration and universal education and health care they blame the u s embargo
