government was not using food as a tool in the election  there is no use of food as a political weapon it is the other way around it is the relief agencies followed by the u s government that have been using food as a political weapon chidyauskiku said to the associated press they have gone out into the countryside and they have been telling zimbabweans that if you don t vote for the opposition if you don t change your vote there s no food for you yesterday united states and united kingdom diplomats were stopped in their vehicles in an incident the us called outrageous and said that they
