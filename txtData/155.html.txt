following the high court s directions that action be taken against 18 000 illegal structures that came up during 2001 2005 meanwhile after taking demolition action against malls constructed in lal dora area at building number 1 and 2 on mehrauli gurgaon road the municipal corporation of delhi mcd today began demolition action at number 13 the biggest mall in the area which houses shops of some of the country s leading fashion designers demolition work at mg 13 mall began this morning here amid tight security an mcd spokesperson said the demolition of the mall comes after the delhi high court last week expressed anguish over the cosmetic demolition carried out by the authorities in the lal dora area today s demolition action comes close on heels of the mcd carrying out demolition work on mg 1 and mg 2 malls that boasted outlets by some of the country s leading fashion designers the action followed the high court order on january 31 asking the municipal corporation of delhi to strictly carry out demolitions in the lal dora area notwithstanding political pressure while the mall at 1 mg road came up in 2001 the adjoining sprawling complex on 2 mg road became operational in 2004 seeing the growing popularity of these two malls other similar complexes recently came up in the area making mehrauli gurgaon road a major traffic bottleneck due to heavy rush of shoppers and unauthorised parking by the roadside over the years almost a dozen malls and complexes have illegally come up on mg road that fall under the lal dora area similarly most of the 350 odd lal dora villages have witnessed the mushrooming of illegal shopping arcades with south delhi being the worst violator the bjp yesterday demanded the restoration of the 1963 notification which clearly stipulates that building bylaws are not applicable in the lal dora villages so as to save properties under lal dora from demolition and to stop cruelty on rural folk the bjp moved a resolution to restore the notification at a meeting of the mcd standing committee here today bjp demands act to protect capital s villages tribune news servicenew delhi february 23 the bjp delhi pradesh president dr harsh vardhan has demanded the delhi villages protection and development act may be put in place and implemented for all round development of villages in the capital he said that at present the condition of all urbanised and rural villages of delhi was pathetic employment resources of the villagers were being destroyed on the tughlaqi orders of the mcd without considering the human aspect and the fact that houses business and industries were being ruined the villages of the capital were lagging behind due to lack of basic civic amenities dr harsh vardhan said that building bylaws made for the delhi villages during british rule and thereafter by the mcd had lost their relevance now the government machinery was exploiting and adopting corrupt practices against the villagers due to these age old bylaws thereby blocking the path of development of the villages differences were also being created in the villages due to politics of votes as such he underlined the need that a comprehensive survey may be conducted of all delhi villages keeping in view the human aspects the problems of every village should be heard separately by inviting people from 10 12 villages in groups after listening to them a comprehensive plan may be made to solve the problems village wise in a time bound manner and be implemented with full will power and sincerity dr harsh vardhan demanded that all present exploiting laws and bylaws should be done away with it may be ensured to provide basic amenities at homes shops business industry living standard environment livelihood employment under delhi villages protection and development act the villages be kept free from heavy taxes and license fees etc green area line may be earmarked and notified by extending the lal dora and keeping in view the need of the villagers in every village he said all problems of the villages can be solved by constituting a high level committee of villages and public representatives and the union urban development ministry the union home ministry the delhi government the dda the mcd and the delhi police he underlined the need to hear the viewpoint of the villagers by adopting a human approach at present the mcd is exploiting the villagers by treating them as enemies of development as well as of delhi as a whole this behaviour was totally unexpected in any democratic set up he added passenger tax to be levied on school buses abhay jaingurgaon february 23 the haryana government has withdrawn the passenger tax exemption on academic institutional buses from february 2006 in exercise of the powers conferred by section 10 of the punjab passengers and goods taxation act 1952 punjab act 16 of 1952 the governor of haryana rescinded the order contained in the excise and taxation department dated september 1970 regarding exemption to school buses as per the notification issued by ramendra jakhu haryana financial commissioner and principal secretary transport department the buses of educational institutions may in lieu of the tax chargeable on fare and freight pay a lump sum amount of rs 60 per seat per month from july to march the district transport officer dto mr narinder singh yadav informed the tribune that the local office has already started sending notices to school authorities in this regard  we have identified 412 buses as per our record which have been engaged by the school authorities the tax for a 52 seat bus would be rs 3 120 per month said mr yadav the government has re imposed the tax on buses of educational institutions as most of the institutions are running on profitable basis and not on charity basis as they used to run earlier he added mr yadav estimated that gurgaon and mewat would have as many as 500 buses engaged by schools in effect more than rs 15 lakh per month extra revenue would be collected on this account he added however a principal of a leading school said that rs 60 per seat per month would result in an extra burden on the students as the school authorities were not earning out of the transportation facilities provided to the students it would be better if the government charged a nominal amount as passenger tax from school authorities he added beware of property pre launch offers tribune news servicefaridabad february 23 even as a number of pre launch advertisements offering plots and flats for advance booking and purchase have been appearing in the media people are finding it difficult to establish the genuineness of the offers with the authorities yet to release the list of authorised builders many of the prospective buyers fear that they could become victims of misinformation it may be recalled that advertisements regarding such offers have been appearing for the past several months in some of the leading dailies according to sources the department of town and country planning has objected to some of the advertisements by certain companies which had failed to obtain the necessary license according to a local resident who had applied against one of the offers plots and flats have been oversold even though constructions are yet to begin when the deputy commissioner mrs g anupama was contacted in this regard she informed that she had come to know of certain irregularities in some of the offers and had prepared a detailed report for the higher authorities in chandigarh it is learnt that the department of town and country planning had issued notices to some of the builders and dealers making such offers in rewari district according to sources selling of apartments and plots under the pre launch category had no legal standing and was a violation of the punjab schedule roads and controlled area restriction of unregulated development act 1963 and the haryana urban development act 1975 the administrator haryana urban development authority huda mr sudhir rajpal said that his office had nothing to do with the offers made by private builders or companies as the license in this regard was issued by the department of town and country planning fog foxes met office vibha sharma tribune news servicenew delhi february 23 these days a rather unusual and interesting weather phenomenon it cannot be termed as freak though in delhi has people as well as the met office somewhat foxed when on certain days morning fog descends upon the city it happened on tuesday on february 17 and the week before that when despite relatively high temperatures in the morning the city remained enveloped in moderate fog till about 9 am needless to add this sudden development led to a delay in incoming and outgoing flights and also some confusion on roads but what makes such events an unusual phenomenon is the fact that of the three essentials for the fog formation to take place on all the three days two were not in its favour and of them one temperature that is particularly so fog which is nothing but low clouds occurs when three factors favour it low temperatures high humidity and no wind condition some weathermen say that any one of these conditions has the power to veto fog however despite delhi recording a relatively high temperature in the morning low to moderate fog descends upon the city particularly the relatively open areas met officials agree that such occurrences do not happen quite often they also agree it is unusual though not a freak phenomenon  this has happened before they say while admitting that fog usually descends when temperatures are low they are also quick to add that though the three factors are mandatory for fog formation it is not as if their contribution has to be equal in somewhat complicated met jargon they explain how unequal combination of three factors can also lead to the formation of fog they also add that there has been sufficient moisture in the air which is why even while the temperature was high conditions become favourable for the optimisation process for the formation of fog meanwhile another explanation for occurrence of fog on relatively warm mornings could perhaps be the impact of pollution and urbanisation some weathermen say that if condensation nuclei dust particles or pollutants are present in sufficient numbers in the atmosphere condensation of the moisture in the air can comfortably take place around them with sufficiently high level of pollutants in the city s air maybe delhiites could expect to see more of this phenomenon in the future woman gets life term for abetting niece s gang rape tribune news servicenew delhi february 23 a delhi court has sentenced a woman to life
