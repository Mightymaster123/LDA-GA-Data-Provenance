advertisementby peter s goodman and jack healyapril 3 2009with 663 000 more jobs disappearing from the american economy last month swelling the total number of jobs surrendered to the recession beyond five million the government s response to the downturn is being put to a strenuous test when drafting plans in january to spend roughly 800 billion to stimulate the deteriorating economy the obama administration operated on the assumption that the unemployment rate would reach 8 9 percent by the end of the year without the extra federal spending three months into the year the unemployment rate has already soared to 8 5 percent from 7 6 percent the highest level in more than a quarter century between january and march more than two million jobs were lost according to the labor department s employment report released friday the severity and breadth of the job losses in march which afflicted nearly every industry outside of health care prompted economists to conclude that an agonizing plunge in employment prospects was still unfolding advertisement it s really just about as bad as can be imagined said dean baker a director of the center for economic and policy research in washington there s just no way we re anywhere near a bottom we ll be really lucky if we stop losing jobs by the end of the year advertisementthe pace of retrenchment has prompted talk that another wave of government stimulus spending may be needed to accompany the 787 billion already in the pipeline  we re clearly looking at a worse downturn than they had been anticipating when they planned the stimulus said mr baker whose organization tends toward liberal policy prescriptions we re going to need some more but others not least decision makers inside the obama administration deemed such talk premature the dreadful jobs report landed among tentative signs of improvement in a few areas of the economy with recent snippets of data lifting stock markets and sowing cautious hopes that the

three months of 2008  the downturn is still very intense but it s no longer intensifying said mark zandi chief economist at moody s economy com the surge of government spending is just beginning to work its way through federal and state bureaucracies and is expected to support jobs in construction and related industries later this year  we re attacking this in a very aggressive way the labor secretary hilda l solis said friday in an interview arguing that it was too early to consider another round of stimulus spending we will revisit that once we expend all the money that we have accrued advertisementfor now the same factors that have assailed the economy for more than a year remain in force with tattered banks reluctant to lend and even healthy households and businesses averse to borrowing and investing in the face of grave uncertainty the very perception that millions more will lose jobs and housing prices will fall have turned such outlooks into reality as businesses scramble to cut costs and confront gloomy sales prospects many are shrinking their work forces removing more paychecks from the economy  there s a lot of survival job cutting going on throughout american business said stuart g hoffman chief economist at pnc financial group in pittsburgh there won t be any job growth at all this year the economy is far far from being out of the woods still mr hoffman is inclined to wait a few months and hope for improvement before calling for a new wave of stimulus spending  you don t just double the dose if the patient doesn t immediately improve he said
