KIC 8462852: Whereâ€™s the Flux? | AstroWright
a little over a year ago tabby boyajian gave a seminar here at the center for exoplanets and habitable worlds about her research while she was here she showed me some crazy light curves from kepler spotted by her team of planethunters did i have any idea what it might be she wondered we tossed around ideas but i was stumped tabby s team had spectra which helped rule out some possibilities it s clearly an f star and the fuzz in the second panel above is due to its 0 88 d rotation period but those dips are crazy one can think of lots of ways stars can behave oddly like this but almost all of them invoke young stars this star is moving too fast to have formed recently and doesn t show any infrared signs of a big disk that you would associate with the material that could cause those dips and there aren t any star forming regions in that part of the sky anyway how could an old star do this interestingly i had been working on a paper about detecting transiting megastructures with kepler the idea is that if advanced alien civilizations build planet sized megastructures solar panels ring worlds telescopes beacons whatever kepler might be able to distinguish them from planets luc arnold wrote a nice paper about this and i was turning my blog post on the topic into a proper journal article one of the things that occurred to me is that a civilization that would build one megastructure would eventually build more the star might be surrounded by them a dyson swarm what would that look like if they were small it might be a flickering or even just a general dimming but if they were very large you would get dips it would look maybe like kenworthy and mamajek s giant ring system but without the obvious symmetries the analogy i have is watching the shadows on the blinds of people outside a window passing by if one person is going around the block on a bicycle their shadow will appear regularly in time and shape like a regular transiting planet but crowds of people ambling by both directions fast and slow big and large would not have any regularity about it at all the total light coming through the blights might vary like tabby s star my philosophy of seti section 2 3 of this paper is that you should reserve the alien hypothesis as a last resort one of the reasons not stated in that link is analogous to cochran s commandment to planet hunters prior to 51 peg b s discovery thou shalt not embarrass thyself and thy colleagues by claiming false planets it would be such a big deal if true it s important that you be absolutely sure before claiming you ve detected something lest everybody lose credibility much more so for seti but from a seti perspective one should focus one s resources on the best targets looking for astronomical anomalies is a reasonable way to focus one s search there is no inconsistency between assuming purely natural explanations for all phenomena and targeting seti efforts at the most astrophysically inexplicable phenomena i found tabby s star to be inexplicable so i contacted andrew siemion at the berkeley seti research center i told him we had a very strange star and how does one go about doing a radio seti search the green bank 100m telescopeandrew was initially skeptical but he quickly agreed that this is a great target he tabby some of the planethunters and i put in a green bank telescope proposal to do a classical radio seti search la contact and i went to work on my paper then a few things happened first tabby s team published up kic8462852 that s the name of the star with the appropriate subtitle where s the flux we call it the wtf star internally although i more commonly call it tabby s star or lgm 2 this is such a cool object i really want to know what s going on kudos to the whole planethunters team for such an amazing find tabby s team tentatively settles on a plausible but contrived natural explanation for it a swarm of comets recently perturbed by the passage of a nearby star i would put low odds on that being the right answer but it s the best one i ve seen so far and much more likely than aliens i d say if i had to guess i d say the star is young despite all appearances i can t back that up anyway a few weeks later andrew gave some congressional testimony and while down there met ross andersen of the atlantic andrew told ross about tabby s star ross interviewed tabby then ross interviewed me we know each other from an earlier story and then ross wrote up an article about tabby s star ross s story is well written and plays up the megastructure angle in a compelling way the internet went aflutter i m glad for phil plait s sober take he gets it just right the british tabloids did their predictable thing i won t link they couldn t even be bothered to get my name right much less convey the proper sense of proportion and it s all still taking off i m really glad that tabby s star is getting so much media coverage it s a great mystery but i am a bit embarrassed about the less responsible reporting overstating the evidence here especially since we didn t have anything ready to show our professional colleagues so that they can give reporters informed takes on it i usually don t post papers prior to acceptance but we have a favorable referee s report and everyone s asking so since the internet seems to be eating this up i asked co author kim cartier to post it to the arxiv you can find it here section 4 is what you are looking for i think we are an advanced society if many of our best minds think it s not a good idea to contact a highly advanced society don t you think they might think the same and disguise what they have if so how can we think we can rule out anything with our relatively new technologies compared to such a society we have discovered stealth many years ago what do you think they ve discovered and visit my article bellow http klinikutamagracia net jenis penyakit kelamin pria penyakit kelamin wanita 10267 htmli put this on tabby s team blog for oct 5th the hypothesis for tabby s star s short term transit dips and long term dimming two proto elementary planetary rings each with multiple sub rings with varying orbital speeds that bisect each other say an an angle of 30 degrees this produces ongoing collisions generating dust as the bodies in the bisecting rings collide while at the same time bodies align so as to create significant dips in the flux such an interesting find i like the latest idea of a super sized jupiter with rings and trojan swarm https www instagram com p bzahlgvfl5k taken by adamgdogsuch a civilization would be working on scientific advances for thousands if not millions of years longer than we have in fact they probably aren t even there anymore with the age of their sun i hope be astrounotvisit my wesite http luna idone theory i haven t heard yet is a cluster of brown dwarfs orbiting the star kic8462852 with combinations occulting the star periodically if there were a cluster of 10 30 such dwarfs of significant mass in a tight formation their occultation pattern would look chaotic non periodic due to perturbations of each other if the star were orbiting such a cluster the long term century decline could be the star going behind the cluster the star could be near the center of the cluster or orbiting within the cluster it may be a normal star that has migrated into or near this cluster of otherwise undetectable objects the way stars in the spiral arms of the milk way have been known to migrate far from their initial nursery various configurations could probably be found to match the observed signal using automated orbital simulation software kind of a trial and error reverse engineering technique the machine and round off error of numerical integrating highly perturbed orbits may render the absolute accuracy of the simulation questionable but potential configurations of occulting objects may be discernible the attached link below is a luminosity vs days plot of tabby s star for the last several months by amateur observers around the world who are keen on variable stars from what i have read the plan is that if they see a significant change in brightness they will alert professionals at bigger scopes so that more powerful instruments can take data real time spectroscopy data and hopefully ir during a dimming event should give us more to chew on does anyone know if this happened http beautyjaket comyour email address will not be published required fields are marked commentname email notify me of followup comments via e mailastrowright
