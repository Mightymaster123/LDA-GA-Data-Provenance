BBC NEWS | Science/Nature | Huge bird-like dinosaur unearthed
while some have theorised that meat eating dinosaurs got smaller as they evolved to be more bird like this beast weighed about 1 400kg 3 080lbs that is about 35 times heavier than other dinosaurs of its ilk nature journal reports that the beaked animal was 8m 26ft long and twice as tall as a man at the shoulder yet it was only a young adult when it died the authors suggest the dinosaur s enormous size was due to a fast growth rate faster even than the precocious tyrannosaurus rex however precisely what it ate is a mystery gigantoraptor erlianensis had some features associated with meat eating dinosaurs such as sharp claws for tearing flesh but it also had some features associated with plant eaters such as a small head and long neck arrested developmentchinese researchers uncovered the fossilised remains of the flightless giant in the erlian basin in inner mongolia the researchers had originally thought they had found the bones of a tyrannosaur the group of dinosaurs to which t rex belongs due to their large size according to lines of arrested growth detected on its bones it died in its 11th year of life the team says it is very probable g erlianensis had feathers although none were identified from the recovered fossils  it was a very surprising discovery not at all what we expected said xu ling a palaeontologist at the chinese academy of sciences in beijing and co author on the nature paper  we think it s the largest feathered animal ever to have been discovered growth spurtgigantoraptor could probably run relatively quickly on its long powerful legs  they show that it had a very fast growth rate so it probably got big by growing very rapidly rather than growing for a very long period of time dr barrett added that the animal was not on the direct evolutionary line leading to today s birds this supported the notion he said that the features we associate with modern birds probably arose more than once in their close relatives most popular now 56 514 people are reading stories on the site right now
