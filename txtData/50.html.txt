editor s note the following was written in the spirit of april fool s day brian is following the story and if there are real reports of outbreak he ll report them in a separate post reports are trickling in about the impact from the conficker worm as infected systems passed zero hour at midnight and began downloading additional malicious components here s a quick roundup of some of the more notable incidents caused by conficker so far according to published reports  a nuclear missile installation near elmendorf air force base outside of anchorage alaska briefly went on a full scale military alert after technicians manning the bunker suspected that several of their control systems were infected with conficker according to wire reports the remote facility temporarily moved to defense condition defcon 3 in the pre dawn hours but quickly backed down from that posture an airman at the installation who asked not to be identified blamed the mishap on way too much caffeine consumed by occupants inside the secluded underground control room the airman said the facility s lead engineer became agitated and inconsolable after watching an internet broadcast of sunday night s hard hitting 60 minutes expose on the conficker worm entitled the internet is infected  in iceland conficker brought a brief thaw to the long economic winter that began last year with the government s inexorable slide into bankruptcy according to local news reports shortly after midnight local time an atm in the capital city of reykjavik began spewing 100 krona notes banking officials there reportedly said the microsoft windows based based bank system began disbursing the bills after a local prankster crammed an infected usb stick into the maw of the teller machine  londoners woke up to find the iconic clock tower big ben stopped at precisely one minute till midnight the british tabloids blared that the giant timepiece had been felled by the conficker worm but security officials reasoned that the beloved landmark legendary for its reliability would have stopped exactly one minute later had the expected 12 00 a m updates to conficker actually been the culprit several members of parliament are now calling for a full investigation into the incident  in waukesha wis leroy mac macelrie 64 turned himself in to local police claiming he was the author of the original conficker worm and that all of the subsequent versions were mere copycats according to charging documents macelrie said he wrote the worm to get back at microsoft founder bill gates for not stopping spam by 2008 like he said he would the man was released on his own recognizance but several hours later a local television station captured footage of the man standing on a nearby street corner repeatedly

laught this am posted by jotulloch april 1 2009 9 47 am report abuseah mr krebs i actually fell for this piece and while i sit here chagrined i also think about the general public who fall for the legitimate news outlet stories about the big bad worm that will bring the house down today if people perceive and subsequently assume that something horrid will happen to their or their employer s computer s today then what impact does that have on how they carry out their daily activities how have those people and the generally ignorant non it literate mainstream media been socially engineered by the mere threat of something that might go wrong sure sounds like the former administration s constant state of orange alert posted by cb12 april 1 2009 10 00 am report abuse what really amuses me

april 2 2009 12 08 am report abuse editor s note the following was written in the spirit of april fool s day brian is following the story and if there are real reports of outbreak he ll report them in a separate post thank you for the clarification if the post feels that this note is required then i suggest appending the headline with april fools as that will keep news readers clear on what they are getting when they click the link to the humor piece yeah i get that this is an april fools piece but neither the post nor brian krebs publish unlabeled fiction in the paper at large and on this page specifically more importantly the readers perception and expectation is that the security fix column blog contains succinct useful and factual i t information please keep it that way and keep up the truly great work  am210sa who posted above got it right please do consider writing for the onion when crafting satire posted by cb12 april 2 2009 9 07 am report abusewell i don t care about these

recommend their computer service to everyone posted by chrismartin3 april 2 2009 9 04 pm report abusei enjoyed the story april 1 is a day for foolishness from people who are usually serious the onion gets all the other days of the year as far as the conficker hysteria i agree that like y2k things would be worse without a lot of work behind the scenes but they re pretty bad already and not just because of conficker waledac is still quite active but its spammers seem to be doing a good job avoiding attention by scrubbing their email lists of spam reporters http spamtrackers org index html reuters has a list of numerous active waledac domains and a sample of how many different ip addresses can be found hosting it within just a few seconds of frequent lookups and unlike conficker your av program probably won t detect it instead of one day of april fool s panic people need to develop some healthy concern about all the malware on their computers the rest of the year posted by
