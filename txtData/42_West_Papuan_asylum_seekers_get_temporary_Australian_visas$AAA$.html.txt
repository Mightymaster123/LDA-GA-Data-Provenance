province to indonesia in 1969 a spokesman for the free west papua campaign nick chesterfield said the decision highlights the dire situation what this clearly demonstrates is that the world needs to wake up to what is happening in west papua and start to actively look at ways of ending the sickening violence that the indonesian military continues to inflict on the people of west papua mr chesterfield said  rather than being isolated and locked up thousands of miles away on christmas island these very courageous individuals can receive the support they deserve from the local community this decision also means australians will be able to hear first hand about the atrocities and escalating human right abuses that are unfolding in one of our closest neighbouring countries said mr
