brewing up nicely journalistic impartiality forbids me from taking sides but what i will say is that i m enjoying the french television coverage provided by channel tf2 every time the race passes a chateau the television coverage pans away from the riders to give viewers a brief history on said historical building nice 1357 up to the 26km point and you can tell the riders are taking it very easy as they are being outsprinted by a horse rider 1348 the race is past the 20km with the quickstep team leading the peloton already fans are gathering behind barriers on the champs elysees with the race

tour de france made its grand depart from london to be precise it was just 22 days ago that about one million people crowded the route of the prologue those scenes prompted a delighted tour director christian prudhomme to enthuse if this is not a success i don t know what a success is but what has occurred since then positive drugs tests for pre race favourite alexandre vinokourov cristian moreni and patrik sinkewitz plus the sacking of race leader michael rasmussen has been anything but a triumph even controversial musician pete doherty might blanch at the drugs revelations this race has produced while the international cycling union tour and tour organisers continue to squabble over the best way to stamp out doping which is a pity because the race has provided one of the closest finishes since greg lemond snatched victory from laurent fignon in 1989
