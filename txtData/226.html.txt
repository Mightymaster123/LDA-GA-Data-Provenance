403 forbiddennewark a rare earthquake centered in virginia rattled parts of new jersey and new york shortly before 2 p m today causing buildings to sway in cities and towns across the region there were no immediate reports of any injuries or structural damage but the quake rattled nerves the u s geological survey reported that a magnitude 5 9 earthquake hit at 1 51 p m and the epicenter was northwest of richmond va about halfway to charlottesville the associated press is reporting the quake was felt in washington d c new york city and north carolina the quake was later downgraded to a magnitude 5 8 u s g s geophysicist julie dutton said an earthquake of this magnitude is rare for the east coast but that the effects are felt widely in our region because quakes move more easily through the bedrock  it is definitely unusual to have a magnitude 5 9 earthquake in virginia dutton said the east coast quake followed a 5 3 magnitude shaker in colorado but dutton said the two events most likely are not related  it s actually about 6 kilometers deep which is pretty typical for quakes in the east he said they re very shallow don blakeman a geophysicist at the usgs said the magnitude of the earthquake might change once more data is available the 5 8 magnitude earthquake that was felt shortly before 2 p m in several states along the east coast this afternoon originated in central virginia more than 300 miles from newark blakeman said there are fault lines throughout the east coast but scientists have yet to identify where the main ones would be he said the makeup of the earth s surface in the east coast ensured that the quake was felt throughout the region virginia s largest recorded earthquake was in 1897 and was of the same magnitude as the one today according to the u s geological survey the last earthquake in the greater new york area was recorded at 1 6 magnitude on june 9 in south plainfield  the crust in the eastern part of the u s carries the quake much more energetically blakeman said this will have been felt all the way up into new england west and down into the carolinas as he was speaking blakeman said the usgs had just registered an aftershock at roughly 2 40 p m there absolutely will be aftershocks when you have a good size earthquake that s shallow in the crust blakeman said jonathan husch chair of the department of geological environmental and marine sciences at rider university in lawrenceville estimated the intensity was about a 3 in new jersey meaning most people felt a mild shaking as if a large truck was passing their building or house  earthquakes in the eastern part of the u s are not unusual they re not common but they re not unusual he said the quake in virginia may be the largest ever recorded in that area husch added many scientists who study earthquakes say the new york city area is overdue for a moderate earthquake that will damage buildings this wasn t it husch said around new jerseyin south brunswick police sgt james ryan said the shaking brought staff out of their offices and immediately jammed the township s emergency lines  the 911 line is flooding with calls right now ryan said at 2 p m people want to know what happened they want to know if there was an explosion the quake was felt in the offices of alcatel lucent in murray hill union county liza ottesen who works as a manager there said her whole desk area started swaying  everything started to sway very slightly gently back and forth it was very odd i m in the middle of a large building and nothing sways back and forth she said i stood up and looked around to see if anyone else had noticed the same thing and everybody was doing what i was doing she said there was no damage but described the feeling as strange  it was a swaying that is not supposed to happen to a building she said middletown police also reported some minor damage at a sears store  a couple ceiling tiles fell out sgt paul bailey said and maybe the supports that hold them up nothing earth shattering pardon the pun in plainfield employees in the park madison building a mix of local and state government offices were evacuated after the tremor according to james pellettiere a union county spokesman  they were quickly brought back into the building pellettiere said farther north in the county s six story administration building in elizabeth there was a continuous shaking according to sebastian d elia another spokesman  the building shook a little bit like spaghetti said d elia who works on the building s top floor it went on for a minute and i kind of got sea sick d elia said the county s emergency management office was jammed with calls a situation being experienced at local 9 1 1 dispatch centers around the state  unless you have damage or emergency issues that need to be addressed please do not call police headquarters he said in new brunswick county employees in the four story middlesex county administration building were evacuated according to county administrator john pulomena the quake was felt in the middlesex county courthouse but although most of the people inside left the five story building there was no official evacuation ordered according to the county sheriff s department j d armelin whose business office is in 75 paterson st in new brunswick said he was sitting in his chair in his office when the earthquake struck  i was in my rolling chair and i started rolling around and it shook armelin said that was crazy he said he first attributed it to the work on the construction next to the building where they are preparing a site for a new parking deck and road but when he got outside he realized it wasn t the project maliek baker was sitting in a barber s chair in the onyx salon on paterson street across from the middlesex county courthouse and felt his chair start to shake  i said to a couple of the barbers that my chair was shaking and they laughed it off baker said then one of the barbers went outside and saw that people were coming out of the courthouse and standing around then he came back in and said maliek you re right it was an earthquake  n j nuke plants report unusual

emergency management received several reports of possible damage to buildings but nothing serious said jay vilardo an emergency management planner  we re just monitoring and assessing calls that are coming in he said around 3 p m just a big scare that s all at bergen community college in paramus esl professor heidi lieb was among faculty members putting in summer office hours when the quake struck  they re doing construction on the building so people probably chalked it up to that but i have never felt a shake like that said lieb everybody s coming out of their office to see what was going on and nobody knows what to do  we don t have any earthquake training she said earthquakes tornadoes we just are not prepared for these kinds of things atlantic city went into emergency mode with evacuations of high rises including hospitals schools casinos and hotels when the tremors hit said city emergency management coordinator thomas foley it also put coastal towns on the alert for a potential tsunami after the quake buildings were inspected for damage foley said city hall employees were sent home because of the late hour by the time the inspection of the building which was not damaged was completed the housing authority evacuated its high rises which did not sustain any damage but one person suffered a heart attack during the event foley said he said he received reports of a crack in a wall in one house and a broken water pipe in another building emergency management officials also notified beach patrol to be on the alert  god forbid we see the water start receding we ve got to immediately evacuate the beach he said but the epicenter of the quake was so far inland that it did not pose a threat of a tsunami there are minor scattered outages reported on pseg s online outage map according to pseg s spokeswoman karen johnson no outages in their coverage area resulted from the earthquake at this time there are very few reports of damage to any infrastructure in the state roadways bridges and tunnels all seem to be intact deptford township in gloucester county has reports of a gas leak on one street craig drive and there have been several residential evacuations at that location gloucester county college also reported a gas leak in one building that has since been evacuated there were no reports of any injuries down the shoreon a packed 26th street beach in avalon the tremors forced people upright in their beach chairs looking quizzically at each other for 10 seconds until the shaking stopped  do you feel that people shouted to each other dozens of beachgoers reached for mobile phones which quickly overloaded the capacity and prevented most calls from going through in cape may it was more of a shimmy than a quake along the beach but the odd rumbling underfoot was enough to cause people to break from a lazy afternoon of tanning and sit up from their lounge chairs to look around in amazement at the beach umbrellas wiggling in concert strangers who had ignored each other all day suddenly looked across chairs and blankets to asked in disbelief is this an earthquake it lasted nearly 45 seconds long enough to convince any doubters and those sunbathers who awoke late from their chairs that it was indeed a quake the two story headquarters for the manasquan beach operations was closed following the quake after walls buckled and several gaps and cracks opened up said walter wall the borough beach manager the building constructed in 1954 will be temporarily shored up and evaluated more thoroughly wednesday regardless of the extent of the damage wall said it could hasten plans to rebuild the structure  there were plans to get a new building anyway wall said so this may expedite the situation the building is the location for the beach offices a room for beach emergency responders lifeguards and police who patrol the beach and boardwalk after hours following the earthquake wall said beach badges were sold just outside the entrance to the building previous earthquakesnew jersey has seen earthquakes before a series of four hit morris county in february 2009 with the largest of a magnitude 3 0 at its epicenter in victory gardens a 2 5 magnitude earthquake hit the same area in december 2009 a pair of quakes also hit somerset county in february 2010 the larger of the two measuring 1 5 a magnitude 5 0 quake centered near ottawa canada shook some parts of new jersey last june though no damage or injuries were reported since new jersey earthquakes are often at shallow levels in the ground witnesses often say they can hear what sound like explosions which is actually the breakage of rocks as it s happening the new jersey area is due for one of its own said alexander gates the chairman of earth and environmental sciences at rutgers newark and an earthquake expert the seismic areas of the garden state are similar to those of virginia and the last major one was in 1884 a magnitude 5 5 centered off the coast of sandy hook which pulled houses off their foundations in geologic terms that means the state can expect one like virginia s tuesday trembler any moment likely in the next 20 years gates said  we re overdue for one about that size right here gates said compiled by star ledger staff writers tomas dinges mike frassinelli david giambusso dan goldberg kelly heyboer ryan hutchins eunice
