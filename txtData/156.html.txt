And the Saga on Arctic Oil Drilling Continues
lawmakers have feuded over drilling in alaska s wilderness for a quarter century ever since congress in 1980 passed a law saying only it could determine whether drilling was permissible in the arctic national wildlife refuge in 1995 the leaders of the new republican majority in congress thought they finally had succeeded in a long sought goal by passing a bill permitting oil drilling in the refuge but president bill clinton vetoed the measure under prodding from environmentalists emboldened by their electoral gains and president bush s reelection in 2004 republicans thought they had gained enough clout on capitol hill this year to muscle the bill through as part of the annual budget process but yesterday proponents were thwarted once again sen ted stevens r alaska hoped he had his adversaries cornered when he attached the drilling plan to an essential measure to fund ongoing military operations in iraq and afghanistan but two republicans joined 42 democrats in filibustering the defense bill that would have authorized drilling last night the senate agreed to pass the defense bill without the drilling provision yesterday s procedural vote in which drilling supporters failed to gain enough votes to end the filibuster and force action gave environmentalists a rare legislative win on capitol hill and it ensured that an oil rich 1 5 million acre stretch of the arctic will remain untouched for the immediate future the refuge which has at least 5 billion barrels of oil beneath its surface shelters birthing caribou as well as musk oxen and millions of migratory birds each year  this is the greatest environmental victory of the year said lydia weiss a lobbyist for the advocacy group defenders of wildlife we are thrilled the senate did not go down the slippery slope of holding a defense bill hostage over this toxic legislation the failure of drilling advocates to push forward a measure that has spent so long on the brink of passage highlights some complicated politics within the republican party gop leaders had to back down earlier this year when moderate republicans in the house protested a move to add it to a comprehensive budget bill but stevens the senate s most influential drilling proponent refused to back down tacking the measure onto the defense spending measure his blunt lobbying tactics were even directed toward his gop colleagues in an e mail he said that if the defense bill failed to go through this would upend the budget process generally endangering favored projects in their states the warning worked with moderate gop sen olympia j snowe maine who issued a statement yesterday after the vote saying that she worried an impasse over the defense appropriations bill would endanger subsidized low income heating funds two key republicans lincoln d chafee r i and mike dewine ohio were unmoved arguing that arctic drilling would not solve the nation s energy problems  we ve got to find other ways to be energy independent dewine said in an interview stevens s year end maneuvering also infuriated senate democrats at one point during sunday night s debate senate minority leader harry m reid d nev slammed his microphone down and refused to allow stevens to respond to criticism yesterday sen joseph i lieberman d conn said stevens was to blame for holding up money for the military  i am not the one threatening support for our troops in the middle of a war lieberman said these senators were bolstered by environmental groups ambitious media and grass roots lobbying campaign this week which featured full page ads in eight national regional and capitol hill newspapers and thousands of phone calls to key senators former president jimmy carter plotted strategy with reid last weekend and spoke yesterday with sen mark pryor d ark who voted against the arctic measure the american petroleum institute condemned the senate action saying its refusal to seize this opportunity does a disservice to american consumers and fails to acknowledge that the consequences of inaction are adverse and significant and even the refuge s most passionate advocates said they expected another drilling fight next year  we ve been arguing about anwr for the 21 years i ve been here it s not going to go away said sen john f kerry d mass i m confident we will see another debate on anwr
