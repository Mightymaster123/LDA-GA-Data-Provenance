the airbus sent an automatic message at 0214 gmt four hours after leaving rio de janeiro reporting a short circuit it may have been damaged by lightning it was well over the ocean when it was lost making brazilian and french search planes task more difficult france s president said the chances of finding survivors were very small  it is a catastrophe the likes of which air france has never seen

doubtsthe airbus 330 200 had been expected to arrive in paris at 1110 local time 0910 gmt the brazilian air force says the plane left radar screens near the islands of fernando de noronha 230 miles from the coast the firmest clue to its fate comes from the data message sent via a satellite network at 0214 gmt reporting electrical and pressurisation problems this suggests whatever happened happened before the crew could put out a mayday radio call it was likely a sudden and catastrophic emergency even a double engine failure at cruising altitude would normally give the crew around half an hour s gliding time air france says the plane may have been struck by lightning but this rarely results in tragedy more likely lightning damaged electrical systems possibly leading indirectly to the plane s ditching although passengers survived a landing on the hudson river in new york in january it is rarely successful especially in the middle of an ocean the size of the atlantic it made its

lost her son a fiancee who lost her future husband  i told them the truth he said afterwards the prospects of finding survivors are very small finding the plane would be very difficult because the
