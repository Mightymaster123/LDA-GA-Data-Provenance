columnist accuses paper s owners of suppressing reportage for fear of losing advertising revenuea senior writer at the daily telegraph has dramatically quit the newspaper after accusing its owners the barclay brothers of suppressing reports about the hsbc scandal out of fear of losing advertising revenue peter oborne the paper s chief political commentator and an award winning author announced his resignation in a blog on the opendemocracy website in which he accused the telegraph of committing a fraud on readers by burying reports on the hsbc tax scandal the journalist quoted a conversation with murdoch maclennan chief executive of telegraph media group whom he said freely admitted that advertising was allowed to affect editorial at the paper referring to the phone hacking scandal which hit rupert murdoch s newspapers oborne argued that democracy was being undermined by shadowy media executives who determine what truths can and what truths can t be conveyed by news organisations mr oborne detailed a series of investigations about hsbc and other financial scandals which he said executives at the newspaper had closed down he declared that democracy itself is in peril if major newspapers allow corporations to influence their content for fear of losing advertising revenue he referred to the telegraph s decision to delete one story hsbc faces 70bn capital hole warn hong kong analysts from the paper s website which reported that the banking giant had overstated the value of the assets on its balance sheet by more than 50bn  the telegraph called mr oborne s attack full of inaccuracy and innuendo the paper denied that its editorial judgements had ever been compromised by commercial imperatives mr oborne an associate editor of the spectator who has presented investigations for channel 4 s dispatches criticised his paper s minimal coverage of the tax evasion scandal which engulfed hsbc and its swiss banking arm he wrote you needed a microscope to find the telegraph coverage nothing on monday six slim paragraphs at the bottom left of page two on tuesday seven paragraphs deep in the business pages on wednesday  the telegraph s recent coverage of hsbc amounts to a form of fraud on its readers it has been placing what it perceives to be the interests of a major international bank above its duty to bring the news to telegraph readers the paper had made a sudden about turn after journalists pursued previous investigations into the bank mr oborne wrote from the start of 2013 onwards stories critical of hsbc were discouraged hsbc suspended its advertising with the telegraph  its account i have been told by an extremely well informed insider was extremely valuable hsbc as one former telegraph executive told me is the advertiser you literally cannot afford to offend  hsbc today refused to comment when i asked whether the bank s decision to stop advertising with the telegraph was connected in any way with the paper s investigation into the jersey accounts  winning back the hsbc advertising account became an urgent priority it was eventually restored after approximately 12 months executives say that murdoch maclennan was determined not to allow any criticism of the international bank as a result of a 2012 investigation into accounts held by hsbc in jersey he claimed reporters were ordered to destroy all emails reports and documents related to the hsbc investigation i have now learnt in a remarkable departure from normal practice that at this stage lawyers for the barclay brothers became closely involved mr oborne who wrote regular columns for the paper on what he perceived to be a moral corruption at the heart of britain s political culture accused his bosses of appeasing chinese interests by refusing to publish critical comment after china barred british mps from a visit to hong kong he argued an editorial operation that is clearly influenced by advertising is classic appeasement once a very powerful body knows they can exert influence they know they can come back and threaten you it totally changes the relationship you have with them a telegraph spokesperson said like any other business we never comment on individual commercial relationships but our policy is absolutely clear we aim to provide all our commercial partners with a range of advertising solutions but the distinction between advertising and our award winning editorial operation has always been fundamental to our business we utterly refute any allegation to the contrary  it is a matter of huge regret that peter oborne for nearly five years a contributor to the telegraph should have launched such an astonishing and unfounded attack full of inaccuracy and innuendo on his own paper or register with your social
