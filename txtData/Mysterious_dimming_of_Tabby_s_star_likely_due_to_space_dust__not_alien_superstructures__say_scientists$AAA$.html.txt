Mysterious dimming of Tabby's star likely due to space dust, not alien superstructures, say scientists - Wikinews, the free news source
saturday january 6 2018 on wednesday a team of over 200 scientists led by astronomer tabetha boyajian announced the mysterious dim and recover behavior of stellar object kic 8462852 also called boyajian s star or tabby s star is likely to be due to clouds of color warping space dust and not a planet another star or as some astronomers have hypothesized a giant structure built by a distant civilization  if a solid opaque object like a megastructure was passing in front of the star it would block out light equally at all colors dr boyajian told the press this is contrary to what we observe and in a separate statement dust is most likely the reason why the star s light appears to dim and brighten the new data shows that different colors of light are being blocked at different intensities therefore whatever is passing between us and the star is not opaque as would be expected from a planet or alien megastructure the research team analyzed 22 months of data collected by an array of ground based telescopes that covered many wavelengths of light the study period lasted from march 2016 to december 2017 which included a number of decreases in brightness the first dip started on the night of thursday may 18 a robotic 14 inch celestron telescope at fairborn observatory in arizona watched tabby s star lose brightness by a dramatic 3 by friday confirming a prediction the star would undergo its unusual dimming events once every 750 days other major telescope projects and citizen astronomers confirmed these findings that dip was complex and continued through to the following sunday after a brief rise in brightness over the weekend it ended a few days later with boyajian and fellow astronomer and co author of the recent paper jason wright discussing the phenomena with the public via twitter will we have a flurry of dips to come stay tuned  dr tabetha boyajian of the university of louisiana tabby s star went through a lot of very strange dimming events that got up to 22 dimmer during the kepler mission and since then we ve been eagerly awaiting another dip and the reason that we ve been waiting for that is that whatever is causing the star to get dimmer will leave a spectral fingerprint behind said dr jason wright of pennsylvania state university after the may event now a co author of the current work so if it s a lot of dust between us and the star that s passing by it should block more blue light than red light if there s gas in that dust that gas should absorb very specific wavelengths so we ve been eager to see one of these changes these dips in the star so we can take the spectra he also addressed space fans at the time via twitter alert tsboyajian s star is dipping this is not a drill astro tweeps on telescopes in the next 48 hours spectra please the primary mission of the kepler project monitored more than 150 000 stars with the primary goal of detecting exoplanets if a star gets dimmer but then recovers a planet may have passed in front of it but tabby s star has shown something else an exoplanet can cause its sun to dim by perhaps 1 and not for very long some of tabby s dips have been this mild but others have hit 20 and lasted weeks it also tends to recover only partially slowly showing a net dimming over the years the plethora of hypotheses behind tabby s star has made it a favorite among space fans and both professional and amateur astronomers space dust was one of the many hypothesized explanations but if that s the reason its origin was and remains a mystery with stargazers speculating many giant comets could be on elliptical orbits or breaking up in front of it or the dips in brightness could be aftereffects of the star consuming a planet some even hypothesized alien civilizations might have been harvesting the sun s energy using a dyson sphere the search for extraterrestrial intelligence seti devoted some observation time to tabby s star in the fall of 2016 as part of the breakthrough listen project no radio or laser pulse signals were detected  this latest research rules out alien megastructures but it raises the plausibility of other phenomena being behind the dimming said dr wright there are models involving circumstellar material like exocomets which were boyajian s team s original hypothesis which seem to be consistent with the data we have some astronomers favor the idea that nothing is blocking the star that it just gets dimmer on its own and this also is consistent with this summer s data this study is a departure from many previous works in that it relies heavily on the work of citizen scientists volunteers who help examine the great quantities of data produced by nasa s kepler mission the follow up observations after the kepler project were funded by a 100 000 kickstarter to continuously monitor tabby s star the unusual behavior of tabby s star was discovered in 2011 by volunteers for the planet hunters citizen science project which was implemented to search for planets in the kepler data  it s exciting i am so appreciative of all of the people who have contributed to this in the past year the citizen scientists and professional astronomers it s quite humbling to have all of these people contributing in various ways to help figure it out dr boyajian said in a statement have an opinion on this story share it share this this
