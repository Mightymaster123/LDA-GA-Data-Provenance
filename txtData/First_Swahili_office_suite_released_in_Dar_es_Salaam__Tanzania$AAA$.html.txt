friday march 4 2005 on monday february 28 2005 jambo openoffice org the first swahili office suite was released at the university of dar es salaam in tanzania the office suite was translated from the english version of openoffice org an open source suite based on sun microsystems staroffice jambo openoffice org was translated by a multinational team including swedish and spanish programmers as well as linguists from the university of dar es salaam monday s release included builds for linux and windows the office suite has four components a word processor a spreadsheet a presentation creator and a drawing program the translation effort required translating 18 000 english strings made up of one or more words many of which have previously had no direct swahili equivalent as part of the translation the team developed a glossary of 1500 technical words in swahili the office suite also includes a spellchecker with a lexicon of 70 000 words swahili is not the only african language into which openoffice is being translated according to ethan zuckerman a fellow at harvard university s berkman center for internet and society openoffice is being translated into nine official languages of south africa by translate org za the same organization is also supporting translation efforts to bring the software into the rwandan language kinyarwanda and hausa a language spoken largely in nigeria swahili is spoken by approximately 55 million people worldwide predominantly in east african countries including tanzania and kenya interview with the project coordinatorreplies to questions from pingswept by alberto escudero pascual march 3 2005the suite contains more than 99 of the strings in swahili the ones that are left in english less than 100 strings out of 18 000 will be worked out in the next release yes this release is fully functional in swahili no alternatives this is the first ever release of a word processor in swahili i expect the software to get installed in all the primary schools of the country i also expect the software to be installed in the main universities of the country and colleges we have postive feedback from them but this is a rather political decision out of my our control the secondary schools have compulsory english so they might not want to install it east africa ufff that is like asking what it infrastructure is in the whole europe d if you mean connectivity all is satellite vsat upstreams most of the local loops in dar are based on ieee 802 11b it is expensive for most of the locals but there is an internet exchange already in dar es salaam where the isp peer together things will always get better the software is placed in the ix the software will spread slowly but i am sure that will spread the tanzanian team will start translating ooo training documentation and next they will work with firefox a linux desktop might come next year i have no idea what will it take to translate knoppix but the priorities should be in getting first a couple of good tools as openoffice and firefox and do loads and loads of training material in swahili i have developed an almost automatic version to update jambooo 1 1 3 in kiswahili the udsm has access to one of the build servers i expect a new release of jamboo maybe 1 1 4 with all the bug corrections in six months the next step is to migrate to ooo 2 0 i have no clear picture of how that will happen nope the win32 version was developed entirely in sweden and spain during christmas 2004 the new build system does not require visual studio to update the swahili strings sida swedish international cooperation agency has funded the university of dar es salaam and the institute of kiswahili research for one full year my company it 46 also was funded by sida to support the project technically it 46 has contributed 50 of its working time at no cost to the project our plan was to be in tanzania only six months and handle all the technology and the training back to the university as we want them to keep on with the development by themselves now we are trying to find similar projects that need support there are many languages out there after all coverage of linux
