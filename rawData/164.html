On payment of the premium and ground rent of Rs 16.40 lakh in May 1988, the plot was handed over to the committee in July 1988. Subsequently, the residents of the locality objected to the construction of the school at the site.</font></p><p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The report says in February 1989, the management committee requested the DDA for allotment of an alternative site. Without waiting for a formal allotment, the DAV committee entered into an agreement with the Reserve Bank Staff Cooperative Housing Society in August 1989 for construction of the school at a plot in Paschim Vihar.</font></p><p><font size="2" face="Verdana">In December 1989, DDA formally offered the same plot measuring 2.492 acre at Paschim Vihar to the committee at a rate of Rs 23.75 lakh per acre. Instead of acting on the offer, the college management committee took up the construction of the school which was completed in three phases between 1990 and 1995, the CAG notes.</font></p><p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Though this land belonged to DDA and not to the RBI Staff Co-operative Housing Society, DDA took no notice till 5 August 1993 when it issued a showcause notice to the committee treating the school as an encroachment and an unauthorised construction, the report cites.</font></p><p><font size="2" face="Verdana">On August 25, 1993, DDA offered to regularise the unauthorised encroachment subject to the condition that the allotment shall be made at the current rates and damages will be paid by the committee for the period of unauthorised occupation of the site. </font></p><p><font size="2" face="Verdana">On acceptance of these terms, the land was allotted to the committee in December 1993 at the rate of Rs 23.75 lakh per acre. The committee deposited the premium in June 1996. In January 1999, DDA issued a notice requiring the committee to pay the damage charges, which had amounted to Rs 35.07 lakh. Despite an assurance given in July 1998 to pay the damage charges, the committee failed to pay the damage charge. However, no action was taken and the damages remained unpaid as of June 2005, viz. even after the expiry of seven years from the date of issue of notice.</font></p><p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Thus, lackadaisical approach of the DDA in protecting its interests had enabled the committee to obtain unauthorised possession of DDA land and thereafter even construct a school building over a period of three years without eliciting any reaction, the report points out.</font></p><p><font size="2" face="Verdana">While the matter was referred to the ministry in August 2004 and a reminder issued in July 2005; their reply was awaited as of December 2005, the CAG report notes.</font></p><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><p><font size="2" face="Verdana"> <a href="#top"><img src="../graphics/top.gif" alt="Top" align="right" border="0" hspace="0" width="35" height="35"></a> </font></p> </td>
