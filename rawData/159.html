A proposal to this effect is being brought up in the Noida Authoritys Board meeting on March 20. </font></p><p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The NRI City in Sectors-96, 97 and 98 along the Expressway has already become a centre of controversy as almost all political parties have been issuing statements about it.</font></p><p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Questioning the logic behind this project, a PIL has reportedly been filed in the High Court against it.</font></p><p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Many influential people are known to have shown undue interest in the development of this project. Now the Noida Authority mandarins have chosen to revive the project, since consigned to cold storage, by giving it a new name.</font></p><p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The main idea to present the proposal with a new name is to dispel the doubts that only NRIs will be allotted plots/flats in this sub-city. This gave an impression that it was to attract only the NRIs, which was not true. This could have discouraged the local citizens from buying property in this project. Hence, it has been decided to change its name to Express City for which a proposal is being brought up for the Boards approval in the meeting on March 20.</font></p><p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The original proposal for setting up an NRI city was approved by the Noida Board in 2004.
