He stresses that Â“There is a need to reflect today Â– the cultivation of a singular identity can kill and kill with abandonÂ”. </font></p><p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Sen gives an example from his own life saying that he was eleven years old when he first encountered murder. He later was a mute witness to the Hindu-Muslim riots that broke out in the 1947 in India. The author also referred to terrorism, September 11, bombings in Britain and the chaos created by violence today the world over. Sen firmly puts across the idea in his book that violence survives today due to the illusion created by a sense of unique identity. It is an identity created by feelings of loyalty to race, religion, nation and region that have created the turbulent mess that exists in the globe today. </font></p><p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The author says that Â“a solitarist approach can be an excellent way of misunderstanding nearly everyone in the world. Take the case of collectivities that have arisen out of region, religion, race, nation ete etcÂ… Each of these collectivities has a particular identity and that is wherein the problem liesÂ”. </font></p><p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Sen stresses that in this situation, individual choice has a central role to play Â“since we belong to a great many groups, the importance we attach to these must have an element of choiceÂ”.</font></p><p><font size="2" face="Verdana">By this the author argues that a man should have the Â“choiceÂ” to change his group. People should accept their groupings out of choice and not because they are passed down to them. This would destroy the singularity and rigidity of groups and encourage true multi-culturalism.</font></p><p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Amartya SenÂ’s insightful talk on his book was followed by a lively panel discussion by Najam Sethi, editor in chief, The Friday Times, Pakistan and N. Ram, editor in chief, The Hindu Group. </font></p><p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The two editors are close friends and long time associates of Sen.</font></p><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><p><font size="2" face="Verdana"> <a href="#top"><img src="../graphics/top.gif" alt="Top" align="right" border="0" hspace="0" width="35" height="35"></a> </font></p> </td>
