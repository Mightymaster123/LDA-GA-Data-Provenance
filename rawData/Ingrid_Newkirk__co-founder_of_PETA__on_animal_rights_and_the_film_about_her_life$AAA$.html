      <p>Last night <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_Box_Office" class="extiw" title="w:Home Box Office">HBO</a> premiered <i>I Am An Animal: The Story of Ingrid Newkirk and PETA</i>. Since its inception, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People_for_the_Ethical_Treatment_of_Animals" class="extiw" title="w:People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals">People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals</a> (PETA) has made headlines and raised eyebrows. They are almost single-handedly responsible for the movement against <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_testing" class="extiw" title="w:Animal testing">animal testing</a> and their efforts have raised the suffering animals experience in a broad spectrum of consumer goods production and food processing into a <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cause_c%C3%A9l%C3%A8bre" class="extiw" title="w:Cause célèbre">cause célèbre</a></i>. </p>
      <p>PETA first made headlines in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_Spring_monkeys" class="extiw" title="w:Silver Spring monkeys">Silver Spring monkeys case</a>, when <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_Pacheco" class="extiw" title="w:Alex Pacheco">Alex Pacheco</a>, then a student at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Washington_University" class="extiw" title="w:George Washington University">George Washington University</a>, volunteered at a lab run by Edward Taub, who was testing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroplasticity" class="extiw" title="w:Neuroplasticity">neuroplasticity</a> on live monkeys. Taub had cut sensory <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ganglia" class="extiw" title="w:Ganglia">ganglia</a> that supplied nerves to the monkeys' fingers, hands, arms, legs; with some of the monkeys, he had severed the entire spinal column. He then tried to force the monkeys to use their limbs by exposing them to persistent electric shock, prolonged physical restraint of an intact arm or leg, and by withholding food. With footage obtained by Pacheco, Taub was convicted of six counts of animal cruelty—largely as a result of the monkeys' reported living conditions—making them "the most famous lab animals in history," according to psychiatrist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Brain_That_Changes_Itself" class="extiw" title="w:The Brain That Changes Itself">Norman Doidge</a>. Taub's conviction was later overturned on appeal and the monkeys were eventually <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euthanasia" class="extiw" title="w:Euthanasia">euthanized</a>. </p>
      <p>PETA was born. </p>
      <p>In the subsequent decades they ran the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stop_Huntingdon_Animal_Cruelty" class="extiw" title="w:Stop Huntingdon Animal Cruelty">Stop Huntingdon Animal Cruelty</a> against Europe's largest animal-testing facility (footage showed staff punching <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beagle" class="extiw" title="w:Beagle">beagle</a> puppies in the face, shouting at them, and simulating sex acts while taking blood samples); against <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Covance" class="extiw" title="w:Covance">Covance</a>, the United State's largest importer of primates for laboratory research (evidence was found that they were dissecting monkeys at its <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vienna,_Virginia" class="extiw" title="w:Vienna, Virginia">Vienna, Virginia</a> laboratory while the animals were still alive); against <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Motors" class="extiw" title="w:General Motors">General Motors</a> for using live animals in crash tests; against <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L%27Oreal" class="extiw" title="w:L'Oreal">L'Oreal</a> for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Testing_cosmetics_on_animals" class="extiw" title="w:Testing cosmetics on animals">testing cosmetics on animals</a>; against <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fur_clothing#Anti-fur_campaigns" class="extiw" title="w:Fur clothing">the use of fur for fashion</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fur_farming" class="extiw" title="w:Fur farming">fur farms</a>; against <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smithfield_Foods" class="extiw" title="w:Smithfield Foods">Smithfield Foods</a> for torturing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butterball" class="extiw" title="w:Butterball">Butterball turkeys</a>; and against fast food chains, most recently against <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KFC" class="extiw" title="w:KFC">KFC</a> through the launch of their website <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KentuckyFriedCruelty.com" class="extiw" title="w:KentuckyFriedCruelty.com">kentuckyfriedcruelty.com</a>. </p>
      <p>They have launched campaigns and engaged in stunts that are designed for media attention. In 1996, PETA activists famously threw a dead raccoon onto the table of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anna_Wintour" class="extiw" title="w:Anna Wintour">Anna Wintour</a>, the fur supporting editor-in-chief of <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vogue_(magazine)" class="extiw" title="w:Vogue (magazine)">Vogue</a></i>, while she was dining at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_Seasons" class="extiw" title="w:Four Seasons">Four Seasons</a> in New York, and left bloody paw prints and the words "Fur Hag" on the steps of her home. They ran a campaign entitled <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_rights_and_the_Holocaust" class="extiw" title="w:Animal rights and the Holocaust">Holocaust on your Plate</a> that consisted of eight 60-square-foot panels, each juxtaposing images of the Holocaust with images of factory farming. Photographs of concentration camp inmates in wooden bunks were shown next to photographs of caged chickens, and piled bodies of Holocaust victims next to a pile of pig carcasses. In 2003 in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerusalem" class="extiw" title="w:Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a>, after <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exploding_donkey" class="extiw" title="w:Exploding donkey">a donkey was loaded with explosives and blown up</a> in a terrorist attack, Newkirk sent a letter to then-<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestine_Liberation_Organization" class="extiw" title="w:Palestine Liberation Organization">PLO</a> leader <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yasser_Arafat" class="extiw" title="w:Yasser Arafat">Yasser Arafat</a> to keep animals out of the conflict. As the film shows, they also took over <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean-Paul_Gaultier" class="extiw" title="w:Jean-Paul Gaultier">Jean-Paul Gaultier</a>'s Paris boutique and smeared blood on the windows to protest his use of fur in his clothing. </p>
      <p>The group's tactics have been criticized. Co-founder Pacheco, who is no longer with PETA, called them "stupid human tricks." Some feminists criticize their campaigns featuring the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lettuce_ladies" class="extiw" title="w:Lettuce ladies">Lettuce Ladies</a> and "I'd Rather Go Naked Than Wear Fur" ads as objectifying women. Of their Holocaust on a Plate campaign, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-Defamation_League" class="extiw" title="w:Anti-Defamation League">Anti-Defamation League</a> Chairman <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abraham_Foxman" class="extiw" title="w:Abraham Foxman">Abraham Foxman</a> said "The effort by PETA to compare the deliberate systematic murder of millions of Jews to the issue of animal rights is abhorrent." (Newkirk later issued an apology for any hurt it caused). Perhaps most controversial amongst politicians, the public and even other animal rights organizations is PETA's refusal to condemn the actions of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_Liberation_Front" class="extiw" title="w:Animal Liberation Front">Animal Liberation Front</a>, which in January 2005 was named as a terrorist threat by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Homeland_Security" class="extiw" title="w:United States Department of Homeland Security">United States Department of Homeland Security</a>. </p>
      <p><a href="/wiki/User:David_Shankbone" title="User:David Shankbone">David Shankbone</a> attended the pre-release screening of <i>I Am An Animal</i> at HBO's offices in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City" class="extiw" title="w:New York City">New York City</a> on November 12, and the following day he sat down with Ingrid Newkirk to discuss her perspectives on PETA, animal rights, her responses to criticism lodged against her and to discuss her on-going life's work to raise human awareness of animal suffering. Below is her interview. </p>

        <b>IN:</b> You have to make allowances, because you know you will not be directing and producing it yourself, so there is some give and take. I hoped what would be shown is the good of the behind-the-scenes PETA, and the footage, and giving a glimpse to people of why we do what we do. You have to take the bits that you wouldn’t necessarily put in your own film.

       <dd>
        <b>IN:</b> That’s like saying to an organization set up to help the homeless, “Is it true you are more concerned with the homeless than people with mansions?” Yes. Obviously we are set up to help the non-humans who don’t have anybody speaking for them because there are countless organizations set up to help humans. Humans can often invariably help themselves. They may have

At one point I thought, ‘Here we are looking into an investigation into another one of these exotic animal places, and yet the biggest problem is that not everyone goes to a game farm, or a roadside zoo for a photo shoot with a bear, but everybody eats.’ I thought we really have to concentrate where

        <b>IN:</b> That’s a great question, because there are two things and they really are in tandem. If I only could have one thing, it would be to end suffering. If you could take things from animals and kill animals all day long without causing them suffering, then I would take it. But I think there’s another question that underlies that. Everybody should be able to agree that animals should not suffer if you kill them or steal from them by taking the fur off their backs or take their eggs, whatever. But you shouldn’t put them through torture to do that. We should all agree on that since we really don’t care at all for suffering. But I think there’s this other question: Who are we that we have set ourselves up on this pedestal and we believe that we have a right take from others everything—including their life—simply because we want to do it? Shouldn’t we stop and think for a second that maybe they are just others like us? Other nations, other individuals, other cultures. Just others. Not sub-human, but just different from being human.

        <b>IN:</b> I don’t know. In this business I am very easy to cubby hole. As someone said to me the other day—they had seen the HBO special—and they said, “Are you really a sad obsessed person?” And I thought, “No, I’m not really a sad person, except when I lie awake at night in winter thinking about all the animals out without shelter, and then I’m sad!” Who wouldn’t be? Wouldn’t anybody be sad if they have a heart? It’s just that I’ve seen so much. In Taiwan, standing in a slaughterhouse for dogs. You have to get through it, and to me, having foster-cared chickens; I know if anyone took a chicken in the way they took a dog in they would come to love that chicken and come to see that chicken had personality. That chicken would wait for you to come home in the evening. They can’t laugh this off, because it’s actually true! Chickens develop bonds with people the same way dogs do. They know you’ve rescued them if you’ve rescued them; they’ll sit on your lap while you’re watching TV. Having had those relationships it’s just as hard for me to stand in a chicken slaughterhouse. But if 
        <i>anyone</i> had had those experiences they would feel the same way. I think it’s hard to pigeon-hole me as sad. I’m not. I’m joyous.

       </dd>
      </dl> 
      <p><b>DS: It’s interesting you brought that up, because a thought I had watching the film is that people always find something to criticize with a person. It’s not, “Okay, Ingrid just really loves animals and wants to help them” but “you’re obsessed and sad.” If you were taking a $1,000,000 salary every year and driving around in a Mercedes, they would say, “She’s not really in it for the animals, she’s completely stuffing her pockets with her cause.” But you are not doing that [Newkirk earned $32,000 from PETA in 2005] and the film makes that clear; so instead, the criticism is that you are sad and obsessed. </b> </p> 
      <dl>
       <dd>
        <b>IN:</b> Right. Thank you. Thank you.

      <p><b>DS: What do you think drives people to jump at negative spin?</b> </p> 
      <dl>
       <dd>
        <b>IN:</b> It’s human nature. You see the thing at a silly level with celebrities. They love them, and then they tear them down. Or they are just salivating, hoping for somebody to trip and fall. I think it’s jut another nasty past of human nature. Especially if you think somebody has done something that makes you a little guilty, it’s very hard to overcome people’s guilt. I know I was the same way when somebody first suggested to me I should not eat animals. I was quite defensive about it. I remember that. There are many other things along the way that I have had to fight out in my own head and get rid of the defensiveness. I think people are defensive, and they don’t want someone to tell them what to do. They know a lot of their life is frivolous. I had an assistant once who wanted to leave for the evening, and I said, “Could you just finish this before you go home?” and he said, “I’ve got a life!” and I said, “Yeah, me too, but mine doesn’t consist of playing video games for five hours!” [Laughs]. But as you get older I think your perspective might change and whatever drives you it occurs you only have so much time, and you want to accomplish this.

      <p><b>DS: Where do you draw your strength from? What’s behind that question is when I was in law school I did a Chihuahua rescue and helped to save perhaps 15 to 20 dogs. I thought it would be a great fulfilling thing, and it would be easy to do to host these animals while I read my law books. Instead, it was grueling. It ended up tearing me apart—</b> </p>

      <p><b>DS: --watching your film I thought, “I would be a terrible investigator. I would be like the guy in the movie who simply couldn’t do it.” I saw a 14-pound dog that was raped by a man and her insides were torn up; I had a dog who almost died on me because it had been so severely starved and beaten, and the only thing I could do to get it to survive was to take a syringe full of blended dog food liquidated with heavy cream and feed it while it bit my fingers. It took its toll on me and it was one of the things that made me very down on humanity—</b> </p>

      <p><b>DS: Where do you draw your strength to continue on and to not hate humanity?</b> </p> 
      <dl>
       <dd>
        <b>IN:</b> I definitely don’t hate humanity, because I am one. I think we’re weak. I think our species loves to think of itself as all important and knowing and clever; and we’re not. Fundamentally, we like a chocolate soda and stay in bed late. We like some rubbish on TV. It’s just the way we are. If everyone could come to America from all over I think they would so they could all get fat and rich and do almost nothing, and collect unemployment. Anyway, whatever. Substitute something there. [
        <i>Laughs</i>] Anthropologists have said that it is only human conceit that has separated us from the other apes; for starters the apes. Really, there is no such thing as a hominid. They say there are 
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hominids" class="extiw" title="w:hominids">hominids</a> and 
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pongids" class="extiw" title="w:pongids">pongids</a>, and we’re probably all in it together and that we are probably all the same taxa. I see 
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/chimpanzees" class="extiw" title="w:chimpanzees">chimpanzees</a> are very much like human beings, and they are very aggressive. The males will go out together and hunt, and they’ll take apart a 
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black-and-white_colobus" class="extiw" title="w:Black-and-white colobus">Colobus monkey</a> just for the fun of it, like a gang on the street. The males will beat their chest and are full of testosterone, and they’ll gang-bang the females, which happens every day if you read the newspaper. And they are lazy. If you put them in captivity they’ll throw their feces at you, but they don’t mean it! That’s just their 
        <i>nature</i>; it’s not as if they sat there thinking this up. It’s their nature.

      </dl> 
      <p><b>DS: Animals don’t scheme.</b> </p> 
      <dl>
       <dd>
        <b>IN:</b> No! They are just angry, upset and agitated. I think that’s the same with human beings. We’re all a bit like that. We have to discipline ourselves and not going around saying how great we are. We have to have some discipline and not be brats and fat little kids. SO I don’t hate humanity, and I forgot what the first one was—oh, how do I get my strength! Where I get my memory is the next one you’re going to ask…[Laughs]
       </dd>
      </dl> 
      <p><b>DS: You do have a great memory.</b> </p> 
      <dl>
       <dd>
        <b>IN:</b> I obviously don’t—a selective memory, maybe. I don’t know that it’s strength so much as I am driven by if I see a cruelty in front of me, which I have many times, and I have the power to stop it, then something comes from inside me and I will try to stop it, and I will really mow people over to get to an injured animal, for example. Or move heaven and Earth to get something fixed. More than that, I have a strong sense of guilt. If I’m not doing anything I don’t know how I could forget that the cruelty is there, or that the pain is there. I don’t think I could just decide, “I’m going to the beach, and I’m going to live on the beach and be a beach bum for the rest of my life” and pretend it doesn’t exist and that it’s not going to haunt me. So I probably do it to ease my own pain, in part, in knowing that it exists and trying to do something. You know!
