Meanwhile, the police were at the receiving end. </font></p><p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Not only that, the rowdies had barged into houses and flats and torched them along with vehicles. Certain residents had run away in fear for their lives. A few, including women, had jumped from the first floor to escape the mayhem. </font></p><p><font size="2" face="Verdana">According to eyewitnesses, it was reminiscent of the Hero Honda factory workers clash with the police and the Dadri railway station violence last year and on Saturday, respectively. Observers feel that lately a very unfortunate tendency among masses for violence is being witnessed increasingly.</font></p><p><font size="2" face="Verdana">In the whole incident, observers felt it was the fault of the Noida Authority. On March 5, the Noida Authority with the help of the Noida police had started repairing the wall between Khora and Rajat Vihar in keeping with the high court orders. But as Khora residents started a demonstration at Vigyan Thapar Gate, the Noida officials and police had to retrace their steps.</font></p><p><font size="2" face="Verdana">People in Rajat Vihar had again gone to the court, saying that the police were guilty of contempt of court for not having carried out the court orders. The police, on their part, had asked for a bigger force in view of local intelligence reports that they might encounter heavy violence from Khora side.</font></p><p><font size="2" face="Verdana">After a second reprimand by the high court, the Noida Authority decided to repair the wall with police help. Armed with huge iron sheets, the police and Noida Authority officials reached the Khora-Rajat Vihar border yesterday. But the police once again had to face stiff resistance. The Noida police are also livid at the role of the Ghaziabad police as Khora Colony is part of Ghaziabad district and had the Ghaziabad police reached in time things wouldnt have gone out of hand to the extent they did. </font></p><p><font size="2" face="Verdana">A two-judge Bench of the Allahabad High Court, comprising Mr Justice B.

Expressing concern over the failure of the authorities to limit the number of brick kilns in the district, prominent Congress party leader and former MLA Rajender Singh Bisla has said it is a matter of grave concern that a large number of brick kilns have come up in the adjoining areas of the city and the district after a ban was imposed on such structures in certain parts of the neighboring districts of UP a few years ago. </font></p><p><font size="2" face="Verdana">In areas where there was acute shortage of sweet underground water, brick kilns consume a large amount of water, besides damaging the upper crust of fertile land between five and eight feet, rendering it useless. </font></p><p><font size="2" face="Verdana">A recent survey of the area found that many farmers in the nearby villages were engaged in leasing out agricultural land for such purposes on the assumption that their land could be acquired by the government. Mr Bisla said the reports revealed a large number of brick kilns had come up in the adjoining areas, especially in Hodal and Ballabgarh subdivisions in the recent past. </font></p><p><font size="2" face="Verdana">It was claimed that about 50 brick kilns in Agra district of UP were shut down following court orders due to the threat of pollution. Some of these had reportedly shifted to Hodal subdivision. </font></p><p><font size="2" face="Verdana">According to experts, there could be several fallouts of the presence of a brick kiln in an area. These included pollution, loss of fertility of the land, damage to the underground water level and loss to overall agricultural production. It was stated that there could be no diversification of farming in such an area and the land could not be used till it was filled up again, which required lots of funds and effort. </font></p><p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Reportedly, the level of underground water, which had been 40 to 50 feet a few years ago, had gone down to 100 feet or more in a majority of the areas, leading to depletion of the sweet water resources.
