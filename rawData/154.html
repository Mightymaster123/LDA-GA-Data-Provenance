The Court said the corporation would target the roads with the width of 80 feet in the first phase after giving notices to the shop owners, giving them chance to close their ventures voluntarily.</p><p>A Bench of Chief Justice Y K Sabharwal, Mr Justice B N Srikrishna and Mr Justice R V Raveendran in a judgement, however, made it clear that the small shops providing ration and other goods of daily needs to residents would not be touched at this stage. The corporation was directed to start with major violation and big commercial complexes like fashion shops, jewelry shops, automobile shops and restaurants in the first phase.</p><p>The direction came on a public interest litigation (PIL) by environmentalist lawyer M C Mehta seeking removal of commercial ventures from the residential areas, which had virtually encroached upon the city roads by expanding their shops on it, causing lot of inconvenience to the public.</p><p>Reminding the Corporation that the rule of law has to be enforced as the city could not be allowed to plunge in chaos, the Court said that the onus would be on the owners of the shops to stop their use in residential areas and if they failed to close their ventures after notices issued by the MCD, the Corporation would take steps to seal them after 30 days of such notices.</p><p>The Court said if they still did not close the shops, the electricity and water supply to such premises should be stopped. The notices to each shop complex should also be displayed on MDCs web site so that every one could access it.</p><p>The Corporation was directed to report back within two weeks to submit a compliance report regarding the steps initiated to implement the Court directive.</p><p>The Court further said that it would consider at later stage if a monitoring committee under its supervision has to be set up to implement its order. The issue of fixing the accountability of officials, responsible for allowing commercialisation of residential areas, would also be considered after MCD had reported back to it.</p><p>To keep the MCD on its toes for speedy implementation of its order, the Court directed its Commissioner to file monthly status report on closing drive by 15 of every month.</p><p>The major roads with 80 feet width to be taken up for clearance by the MCD include Netaji Subhah Marg, Asaf Ali Road, Mathura Road, G T Road, Mahatma Gandhi Road, Bhisham Pitamah Marg, Lala Lajpat Rai Path in Lajpath Nagar, Veer Sawarkar Marg, Siri Fort Road, Savitri Cinema Road, Kalka Devi Marg, Guru Ravi Das Marg, Okhla Estate Marg, Firoz Gandhi Road, C V Raman Marg, M B Road and various other roads in all nine districts of the Capital.</p> </font><p><font size="2" face="Verdana"> <a href="#top"><img src="../graphics/top.gif" alt="Top" align="right" border="0" hspace="0" width="35" height="35"></a> </font></p> </td>

Mr Estabrooks interacted with hundreds of parents on the opportunities available today to give deaf children voices of their own. Children from the Meenakshi Speech and Hearing Centre and Asha Speech and Hearing Clinic, who have resumed a normal, mainstream life after receiving a cochlear implant, put up a cultural performance on the occasion. </p><p>Mr Estabrooks, director of the Learning to Listen Foundation at the North York General Hospital in Canada, also ran three master classes for a small number of professionals in Delhi at the Ganga Ram Hospital, who are training in auditory-verbal techniques. Auditory-verbal therapy assists children with hearing aids or cochlear implants to maximise their listening and speech skills.</p><p>He will be holding workshops in Mumbai (Welingkar Institute of Management, Poddar College) on February 19 and in Chennai at Little Flower Convent on February 25.</p><p>More than 5 million people in India suffer from a hearing impairment and there are more than a million with a severe to profound hearing loss. Mr Estabrooks, the International Ambassador of the Alexander Graham Bell Association for the Deaf and Hard of Hearing, advocates the use of a cochlear implant for those children who no longer receive benefit from a hearing aid. Children who receive a cochlear implant young enough, and receive the appropriate auditory training, should be able to acquire age appropriate language skills and participate fully in mainstream school and community, according to Mr Estabrooks.</p><p>Mr Estabrooks urges parents and health professionals and teachers to ensure children get the best possible opportunity to learn to listen. That means we need to be vigilant about understanding the babys or infants hearing loss and not leaving it too late to provide them with the appropriate aids.</p> </font><p><font size="2" face="Verdana"> <a href="#top"><img src="../graphics/top.gif" alt="Top" align="right" border="0" hspace="0" width="35" height="35"></a> </font></p> </td>
