Also, it is to promote timely and effective dissemination of accurate information on the range of its activities. </font></p><p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Making out a strong case for mass awareness on the right to information and the Act per se, he lamented that the government was found shortchanging on this front.</font></p><p><font size="2" face="Verdana">At one point of his presentation, he observed that participatory democracy entailed that the public has timely and accurate information.</font></p><p><font size="2" face="Verdana">He was making the presentation during an interactive session with the public on the Act organised jointly by the PHD Chamber of Commerce and Industry (PHDCCI) and the Gurgaon Chamber of Chamber of Commerce and Industry (GCCI).</font></p><p><font size="2" face="Verdana">He said that at present eight countries in the world, including the USA and the UK, had Acts relating to freedom of information. While such laws came into existence in the USA in 1966, it came into existence in the UK in 2000. However, the law in UK got into effect only from January 2005. Hence, the law on Right to Information in India is not far behind the most progressive countries. </font></p><p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Rather, in terms of content it is most modern and forward looking than the law on the subject in other countries, he added.

The Act made it very clear, he asserted. </font></p><p><font size="2" face="Verdana">He further said any public authority, including the judiciary, and private organisations which had to part with information to the governmental authorities, fell under the purview of the Act. Even the Supreme Court had accepted the judiciary falling within the purview of the Act, he added.</font></p><p><font size="2" face="Verdana">He said the National Commission had so far received about 800 complaints and has disposed of more than 200 of them.</font></p><p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Speaking on the occasion, the former president of the PHDCCI and founder president of the GCCI, Mr P.

The 66 KW power stations are located at Dallupura, Bhagirthi, Dilshad Garden, Gauda, Group Housing Society 1, Group Housing Society 2, Khicharipur, Kondali, Mayur Vihar Phase 1, Mayur Vihar Phase 2, Patparganj Industrial Area, Tahirpur, Shastri Park, Yamuna Vihar and Vivek Vihar. </font></p><p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The 33 KW power stations are located at Viswash Nagar, CBD Ground, CBD Ground 2, Dwarkapuri, Geeta Colony, Shahdara GT Road, Guru Angad Nagar, Kailash Nagar, Karkardooma, Kanti Nagar, Karawal Nagar, Preet Vihar, DSIDC  Jhilmil, Shakarpur and Silampur. </font></p><p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Hundreds of tonnes of ST cables are stored at every such power sub stations. These cables are highly inflammable. Despite that, fire fighting measures are not up to the mark at these stations, said an officer associated with the Delhi Fire Service (DFS). </font></p><p><font size="2" face="Verdana">He said the BSES had even opened its sub offices in the sub stations in Tahirpur, Bhagirthi, Shahdara GT Road etc. </font></p><p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Apart from the movement of its employees, local people come here in masses and stage protest and agitation here.

What we can do is to strengthen existing fire-fighting measures.
