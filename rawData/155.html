The committee, apart from Khanna, comprises former chief town planner S S Shafi, prominent architect E F N Rebeiro, Delhi BJP chief Harsh Vardhan and Congress MLA S C Vats.

The action followed the High Court order on January 31 asking the Municipal Corporation of Delhi to strictly carry out demolitions in the Lal Dora area notwithstanding political pressure. While the mall at 1 MG Road came up in 2001, the adjoining sprawling complex on 2 MG Road became operational in 2004.</font></p><p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Seeing the growing popularity of these two malls, other similar complexes recently came up in the area making Mehrauli-Gurgaon Road a major traffic bottleneck due to heavy rush of shoppers and unauthorised parking by the roadside. </font></p><p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Over the years, almost a dozen malls and complexes have illegally come up on MG Road that fall under the Lal Dora area.

The villages of the Capital were lagging behind due to lack of basic civic amenities. </font></p><p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Dr Harsh Vardhan said that building bylaws made for the Delhi villages during British rule and thereafter by the MCD had lost their relevance now. The government machinery was exploiting and adopting corrupt practices against the villagers due to these age-old bylaws, thereby blocking the path of development of the villages. Differences were also being created in the villages due to politics of votes.</font></p><p><font size="2" face="Verdana">As such, he underlined the need that a comprehensive survey may be conducted of all Delhi villages keeping in view the human aspects. The problems of every village should be heard separately by inviting people from 10-12 villages in groups. After listening to them, a comprehensive plan may be made to solve the problems village-wise in a time-bound manner and be implemented with full will power and sincerity.</font></p><p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Dr Harsh Vardhan demanded that all present exploiting laws and bylaws should be done away with. It may be ensured to provide basic amenities at homes, shops, business, industry, living standard, environment, livelihood, employment under Delhi Villages Protection and Development Act. The villages be kept free from heavy taxes and license fees etc. Green area line may be earmarked and notified by extending the Lal Dora and keeping in view the need of the villagers in every village. </font></p><p><font size="2" face="Verdana">He said all problems of the villages can be solved by constituting a high-level committee of villages and public representatives and the Union Urban Development Ministry, the Union Home Ministry, the Delhi Government, the DDA, the MCD and the Delhi Police.

The action followed the High Court order on January 31 asking the Municipal Corporation of Delhi to strictly carry out demolitions in the Lal Dora area notwithstanding political pressure.

The tax for a 52-seat bus would be Rs 3,120 per month,Â” said Mr Yadav. The government has re-imposed the tax on buses of educational institutions as most of the institutions are running on profitable basis and not on charity basis as they used to run earlier, he added. Mr Yadav estimated that Gurgaon and Mewat would have as many as 500 buses engaged by schools. </font></p><p><font size="2" face="Verdana">In effect, more than Rs 15 lakh per month extra revenue would be collected on this account, he added.</font></p><p><font size="2" face="Verdana">However, a principal of a leading school said that Rs 60 per seat per month would result in an extra burden on the students, as the school authorities were not earning out of the transportation facilities provided to the students. </font></p><p><font size="2" face="Verdana">It would be better if the government charged a nominal amount as passenger tax from school authorities, he added.</font></p><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><p><font size="2" face="Verdana"> <a href="#top"><img src="../graphics/top.gif" alt="Top" align="right" border="0" hspace="0" width="35" height="35"></a> </font></p> </td>

But what makes such events an unusual phenomenon is the fact that of the three essentials for the fog formation to take place on all the three days, two were not in its favour. </font></p><p><font size="2" face="Verdana">And of them one, temperature that is, particularly so. Fog, which is nothing but low clouds, occurs when three factors favour it: low temperatures, high humidity and no-wind condition. Some weathermen say that any one of these conditions has the power to veto fog.</font></p><p><font size="2" face="Verdana">However, despite Delhi recording a relatively high temperature in the morning, low to moderate fog descends upon the city, particularly the relatively open areas. Met officials agree that such occurrences do not happen quite often. They also agree it is unusual, though not a freak phenomenon. </font></p><p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Â“This has happened before,Â” they say, while admitting that fog usually descends when temperatures are low.</font></p><p><font size="2" face="Verdana">They are also quick to add that though the three factors are mandatory for fog formation, it is not as if their contribution has to be equal.</font></p><p><font size="2" face="Verdana">In somewhat complicated Met jargon, they explain how unequal combination of three factors can also lead to the formation of fog, They also add that there has been sufficient moisture in the air which is why even while the temperature was high, conditions become favourable for the optimisation process for the formation of fog. </font></p><p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Meanwhile, another explanation for occurrence of fog on relatively warm mornings could perhaps be the impact of pollution and urbanisation. </font></p><p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Some weathermen say that if condensation nuclei Â— dust particles or pollutants Â— are present in sufficient numbers in the atmosphere, condensation of the moisture in the air can comfortably take place around them. </font></p><p><font size="2" face="Verdana">With sufficiently high level of pollutants in the cityÂ’s air, maybe Delhiites could expect to see more of this phenomenon in the future.</font></p><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><p><font size="2" face="Verdana"> <a href="#top"><img src="../graphics/top.gif" alt="Top" align="right" border="0" hspace="0" width="35" height="35"></a> </font></p> </td>

According to the court, Saroj and her husband were given the responsibility of looking after the victim after her father died.</font></p><p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Instead of being protected, the girl was raped by her uncle and was Â“scoldedÂ” by her aunt when she tried to complain about him.
