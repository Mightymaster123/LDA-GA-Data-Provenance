        <br>
        <br> You can deny climate change as much as you like. The evidence contradicts you. Any logical study takes account of scientific data which can be reproduced. That is the difference between media reports and the global warming reality. Here we have an up-to-date report on the state of one nation, with many others also recognising and acting on how to combat climate change in a coordinated global response.

        <br> IUCN must be listened to, unless you are one of those who disregards any science on the grounds that it could be fake. Acting is the opposite to disinterest, but what can we do to counter the actions of great industries or the governments of large populations of people? The answer seems bland, but it proves individuals are always important.

        <br> Does the dog in your living room have any similarity to those wild species that we are losing from our savanna and forests? This new discovery of signalling a hunt could lead us to more understanding of much more than our domestic animals. The beauty of the painted dog lies in intricate behaviour and care systems which maintain a society we should envy.

        <br> The extinction of small and large, plant and animal is a daily event now, as climate change increasingly joins the other anthropogenic influences on the species of our planet. Mapping the possibilities and modelling the effects is now finally helping out with the problems, but we still have to conserve, and quickly.

        <br> The polyploids among the animals are the focus of the latest research, given the vast number of plant polyploids and the potential of species that have such enhanced genetic capability!

        <br> Its that season when the bees, wasps and ants are building to a climax in the Northern Hemisphere. ID can be useful, especially when you consider some of the exotic species, but apart from allergy, most of us are safe with these agricultural workers in our economy.

        <br> How will Paris be implemented? Will farming be a major player in preserving our environment as we feed more people than ever existed? The questions for future generations will be thorny, but the rainforest is a thorny clue about conserving what we have left!We're looking forward to seeing how the new NGO copes with expansion as the politics of climate mitigation progresses.

        <br> How can we conserve the beauty of the largest remaining rainforest in Asia? This tract of land, divided by the dry interior, stretches across the Thai border at one end and connects with Indian reserves at the other. Answers to the everlasting problems of conservation must include governance, proper transparency and perhaps most important, grassroots participation at many levels.
