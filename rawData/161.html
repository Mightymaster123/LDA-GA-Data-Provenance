It has especially been affecting the rural areas and people living in the slums. Even mineral water was not a safe bet and the best alternative is to drink only boiled water, said Dr Ohri.</font></p><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><p><font size="2" face="Verdana"> <a href="#top"><img src="../graphics/top.gif" alt="Top" align="right" border="0" hspace="0" width="35" height="35"></a> </font></p> </td>
