Till then, action should be taken only on the ongoing unauthorised constructions and encroachments on government land, said a resolution by the House urging a halt to the ongoing demolition action.</font></p><p><font size="2" face="Verdana">In the resolution pertaining to hawkers in Delhi, the House said, A plan should be framed by the MCD Commissioner to ensure that all the vendors making a living for themselves through unauthorised shops on pavements are not uprooted without working out an alternate source of livelihood for these people, the resolution said.</font></p><p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Another resolution passed by the House urged deferring of action on sealing of commercial units in residential areas of the Capital, as per the order of the Supreme Court. The Supreme court had ordered closing down all commercial units operating in areas having 80 ft or wider roads.</font></p><p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The resolution said that since many commercial units coming under the purview of the order were shops like that of barbers, confectioners, dry cleaners, general stores, chemist shops, educational institutes, nursing homes, coaching centres and bakeries that met the daily needs of common people, any action for sealing of these units should be put on hold till the Committee submits its report and till the implementation of the Master Plan 2021.</font></p><p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The MCD House urged the Delhi Government to immediately pass the above resolutions in the ongoing session of the Assembly and forward it to the Centre so that the Centre and the Delhi Government could present the MCDs case before the Supreme Court.</font></p><p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The three resolutions, introduced by Leader of the House Mr Jitender Kochar, were on Thursday passed by the Standing Committee of the MCD.</font></p><p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The passing of the resolutions by the House was marked by protests by Opposition BJP members Mr Subhash Arya, Mr Vijendra Gupta and Ms Aarti Mehra against Mayor Satbir Singhs rejection of a resolution by Mr Gupta that the MCD Commissioners proposal for providing ad hoc licenses for trades in certain areas also include planned colonies and housing schemes developed after 1957 and unauthorised colonies and all areas falling within the jurisdiction of the MCD.</font></p><p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The Opposition was also agitated over the inclusion in the list of areas in which sealing action against commercial units was proposed to be taken, those places where mixed land use was permitted under the Master Plan 2001.</font></p><p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Later, addressing a press conference, Leader of the House Mr Jitender Kochar and Standing Committee Chairman Mr Mukesh Goel criticised the opposition for creating ruckus in the House when resolutions meant to provide relief for the common man and the small traders were on the agenda. </font></p><p><font size="2" face="Verdana">On the one hand, the BJP says it is working in the interest of the people of Delhi and on the other it obstructs the working of the House just when the three path-breaking resolutions meant to provide relief for common people were introduced in the House, Mr Goyal said.</font></p><p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Mr Kochar said the resolution for deferring demolition action on unauthorised properties as well as on sealing of commercial units were brought in the House after prior consultations with Chief Minister Ms Sheila Dikshit.</font></p><p><font size="2" face="Verdana">An 18-member delegation, which included Congress leaders like Rambabu Sharma and Sajjan Kumar, met the Chief Minister last week and conveyed to her the sense of urgency among the MCD to provide relief to the small traders and commoners by passing the two resolutions in the House at the earliest to enable their passage in the Assembly before the expiry of the deadline set by the courts, Mr Kochar said.</font></p><p><font size="2" face="Verdana">In fact, the resolutions are being sent to the Delhi Government today itself so that the Assembly passes them at the earliest, he said.

Urging people to opt for herbal colours or, better still, products like henna, wheat flour and colours made from dried flowers, experts point out to the need for checking the quality of colours available in the market. </font></font></p><p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Some people, despite the knowledge that chemical colours are harmful, still opt for them because they are readily available and cost less. What these people dont realise is that their negligence can cost others dearly, said Ms Anupa Sharma, who had to undergo extensive eye treatment following a ruptured vein. Cases like her are on the increase with each passing year, claim specialists. The most commonly used colours like blue can cause dermatitis, a condition that often results in swollen, reddened and itchy skin, said Dr Anil Kumar, Consultant Dermatologist at G. M. Modi Hospital.</font></p><p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Pointing out that most Holi colours sold in the market are oxidised metals or industrial dyes mixed with engine oil, experts claim that these chemicals can cause serious harm, including infections that can in severe cases prove fatal.</font></p><p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The green colour, which is by far the most used colour, say experts, is obtained from copper sulphate, which may cause allergies or even temporary blindness.</font></p><p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Similarly, purple, obtained from chromium iodide, is known to cause bronchial asthma and other forms of allergy. Silver, obtained from aluminum bromide, a carcinogenic, and black, obtained from lead oxide, are known to cause renal failure or learning disability. </font></p><p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Dr Kumar even advises against the use of gulal, which is often mistaken for being harmless. Gulal that has two components, a colouring agent and a base, is most likely heavy. Metals like lead, chromium, nickel and cadmium are all capable of disturbing human body functions and damaging the skin at large, he said.</font></p><p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Watercolours having an alkaline base are also capable of causing severe injuries. Dr Purima Sood, Ophthalmologist at G. M. Modi Hospital, recommends immediate medical attention if the colours get splashed into the eyes. </font></p><p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Environmentalist also caution against the use of chemical colours.
