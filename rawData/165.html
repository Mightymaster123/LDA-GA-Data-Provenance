The MCD counsel too submitted that the corporation had sealed all the farmhouses which did not conform to the 60 feet width approach road norms.</p><p>Upon this, Justice Jain asked the MCD to furnish in the court the list of the farmhouses sealed in the Capital pursuant to the courtÂ’s earlier order.</p><p>The DDA was asked to file its affidavit that it was not permitting the functioning of any illegal farmhouses in the city.</p><p>The court also assured that it would look into the complaint of Manjit Singh Ahulwalia, counsel for the petitioner organisation Bhrashtachar Virodhi Sanghatan, that banquet hall in residential areas which were ordered to be closed by the bench were now functioning under the cloak of Â‘community hallsÂ’ and organising social functions. In another matter, the High Court today ordered the Delhi Police Commissioner to take immediate steps to clear the unauthorised structure and presence of some persons who had illegally occupied the grave land of late freedom fighter Maulana Abul Kalam Azad located in the precincts of the historic Jama Masjid.</p><p>A special Bench of Justice Vijender Jain and Justice Rekha Sharma also granted four weeks to the various government agencies to put into motion the re-development plan of the Jama Masjid area estimated at a cost of Rs 93 crore.</p><p>Asserting that the historic masjid should be restored to its pristine glory, the Bench maintained that the grave of Azad should be developed as the Â“appropriate resting placeÂ” befitting his stature at par with that of Mahatma Gandhi and Jawaharlal Nehru.</p><p>Najmi Waziri, counsel for the Delhi Wakf Board and other advocates complained to the court that some persons had clandestinely constructed a structure on the grave land of Azad to live there. The counsels recalled that the court had earlier ordered the authorities to develop the samadhi of Azad which was in shambles into a fitting Â“resting placeÂ” for the great leader.</p><p>It was complained that though the general public was not allowed access to the samadhi for paying obeisance as allowed in the case of Mahatma Gandhi, Nehru and other leaders, the authorities had allowed some persons to construct structures at the place.</p><p>Following the complaints, the Bench asked the Commissioner of Police to initiate steps with the help of Wakf Board officials to clear the persons and encroachments from the place. </p><p>The bench, which reviewed the re-development plan of the Jama Masjid jointly formulated by government agencies like NCT, MCD, Archaeolgoical Survey of India, besides the Wakf Board, asked the authorities to seek the necessary financial approval from the Delhi Government so that the execution of the plan could commence within the next few months.</p><p>The court also maintained that under the proposed re-development plan, all the unauthorised constructions at the place should be demolished but necessary rehabilitation and relocation measures could be taken in the case of deserving occupants of the place. </p><p>The matter was posted for further hearing to May 2.</p> </font><p><font size="2" face="Verdana"> <a href="#top"><img src="../graphics/top.gif" alt="Top" align="right" border="0" hspace="0" width="35" height="35"></a> </font></p> </td>

Violence surrounds us today whether it is in the streets, of social exclusion, radical extremism or of war. </p><p>As such, one of the most immediate responses to violence is made by the media; wherever an incident occurs, someone reaches to report it. Recognizing the sway of violence in society today and in a bid to deal better with it, Jamia Millia Islamia, the Press Institute of India and the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) are holding an international seminar on March 28-29 titled Â‘Reporting Armed Conflict: The Media Debates its Role.Â’</p><p>This seminar is a rare event as it would be attended by editors from leading newspapers from 15 countries, including Pakistan, Bangladesh, Nepal, Sri Lanka, Bhutan and the Maldives. At the seminar, the editors will make presentations and conduct panel discussions on issues related to the nature of modern conflict, international law, state responses to terrorism, media objectivity and media role and responsibilities. </p><p>Former TV journalist Surinder Oberoi, who is one of the organizers on behalf of the ICRC, says Â“The seminar is an opportunity for some public self-analysis by the regionÂ’s most important profession in terms of mass communication. </p><p>The media do not just report the news, they form opinion, which in turn influences or shapes events. We want to see the media recognize the positive role that they can play, and we want them to use their substantial influence to limit the consequences of armed conflict.Â”</p><p>The seminar focuses specifically on armed conflict as most participating countries are facing this problem. For instance, Mike OÂ’Brien, member of ICRC regional delegation in Delhi, feels that, Â“Of the countries whose editors are participating in the event, all except Bhutan and the Maldives currently experience regular levels of internal violence or internal conflict in part of their territory and though not everyone is a direct victim of the violence, many people feel its effects.</p><p>By accurately reporting the effects of conflict or internal violence, the media can draw attention to issues which require resolution at the highest levelÂ”.</p> </font><p><font size="2" face="Verdana"> <a href="#top"><img src="../graphics/top.gif" alt="Top" align="right" border="0" hspace="0" width="35" height="35"></a> </font></p> </td>

The publishers claim it to be the only book providing a comprehensive exposition of every domestic Indian wine. </p><p>The pocket-sized information-packed book can be carried along as a reference guide. The author has visited every functioning winery in India, searching for the best wines, even from among the little-known and fledgling producers. Every single wine made in India as well as international wines are tasted, described and scored which enables the Indian consumer to select the best wines possible. </p><p>The Wine Guide provides everything you need to know about the wine basics: how to properly enjoy a wine, that is, following the three steps of wine-evaluation Â— eye, nose, and taste; it irreverently exposes all the myths of wine etiquette, for example, about the need for special wine glasses or for decanting wine which tend to scare people away from wine. Instead, you learn how to select, order, serve and enjoy wine whether choosing from a wine-list at a restaurant or casually among friends..</p><p>The book concentrates intensively on the Indian conditions, explaining how wine should be served and stored here.</p><p>It provides an interesting sketch of the history of wine-making and drinking in India, from ancient times till now. </p><p>Additionally, there is a concise overview of wines from France, Germany, Spain, the USA, Chile, etc., helping you to distinguish, for example Bordeaux from Beaujolais or Prosecco from Sekt. There is information on how to decipher foreign labels, various classification systems, and of course specific details about wine types, regions, and styles. By the time you have finished this book, you will not just know your Dry from Sweet, but even your Cabernet Sauvignon from Sauvignon Blanc. The wine guide has numerous user-friendly features for the beginners and experts alike. For the beginner, there is an extensive glossary of common wine terms along with a helpful pronunciation guide. For all consumers, there are several handy appendixes: There is a chart listing IndiaÂ’s best Red, White, RosÃ©, and Sparkling wines. There is a chart summarising the best wines for each grape-variety. There is also a comparative chart giving the best value-for-money wines available on the market. </p><p>Ms Devyani Rathore, a diplomat and wife of the author, says the book aims to contribute to the wider awareness of high-quality Indian wines, even as it guides the Indian consumer through all the wines Â– domestic and imported Â– on the Indian market.</p><p>As the author argues, Indian wine, if properly supported and urged on, has a glorious future ahead.</p> </font><p><font size="2" face="Verdana"> <a href="#top"><img src="../graphics/top.gif" alt="Top" align="right" border="0" hspace="0" width="35" height="35"></a> </font></p> </td>
