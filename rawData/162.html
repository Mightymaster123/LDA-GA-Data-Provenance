In case of a fire there, fire tenders have to go from Gokulpuri, Shastri Park or Shahdara fire stations, he said. </font></p><p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Another officer associated with the DFS said that there was an acute shortage of fire tenders and personnel in the existing fire stations. At present, there are only 200 firemen including officers in the whole trans-Yamuna area. As per DFS rule, there must be at least 6 firemen on a fire tender sent to a site of fire. But due to shortage of staff, we are forced to manage with only four, he said. </font></p><p><font size="2" face="Verdana">He said that the whole trans-Yamuna had only 16 fire tenders for an area containing one third of the citys population. There should be at least 10-12 extra fire tenders, he said. </font></p><p><font size="2" face="Verdana">When contacted, the Deputy Fire officer in-charge of the trans-Yamuna area Mr Santokh Singh said that five new fire stations were to be opened soon in the area at Kalyanwas, Dallupura, Mayur Vihar Phase-1, Tahirpur and Yamuna Vihar.</font></p><p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The land for these fire stations has already been identified and the stations will be ready prior to the start of the Commonwealth Games.

Many of the products designed by the students have been used by the Spinal Injuries Centre and the Blind Relief Association. </font></p><p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Perhaps the most outstanding product is a brilliant design of an Easy Braille instrument to aid writing for the blind. Prof Mandeep Singh, Head of Industrial Design, SPA, says, This easy Braille set has been developed by a third semester student, Jaidevi Venugopal. If this model gets picked up, then it will simplify Braille reading. </font></p><p><font size="2" face="Verdana">He further adds, This set, unlike any other, has a negative stylus and a bottom protrusion. Right now, we have begun the procedure for patenting this easy Braille set. The process has been begun by the Dean and approvals have poured in.</font></p><p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Nitin Nagdavane has put together a device to help the physically challenged use regular taxis, like the Maruti Omni. The idea behind this design was to provide city taxis with a facility to accommodate wheelchair users without compromising on the comfort of regular users and with minimum investment in production cost. Nitin has created such a model especially adapted for Maruti vans and taxis. </font></p><p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Yet another resourceful design is that of an easy rickshaw for the old, the obese and the pregnant. This design was evolved by Neha Srivastava. The idea was to make it easier for the physically challenged and others to climb onto a rickshaw and travel in comfort. Neha managed this by dividing the footboard into two parts with a folding seat at negligible extra cost. This not only made it comfortable to get into the rickshaw but also made the rickshaw more stable by bringing down the centre of gravity. </font></p><p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Students have put together designs and successfully constructed computer input peripherals for people with spinal injuries and other related physical disabilities, a device to help aid the process of eating and drinking for people with spinal injuries, a device to help arthritis patients traverse vertical distances, a system to aid the recovery process of spinal chord injury patients, an educative toy for a blind child, a basketball game for visually impaired children to be used on school campuses, a vendor cart for the disabled to make them self-reliant, a wheelchair specifically designed for use in the office environment, a playstation for a primary school that caters to both the disabled and other children, an efficient redesign of crutches as a lifestyle accessory and a recreation tricycle for children with weak lower limbs in the 8-15 year age group. </font></p><p><font size="2" face="Verdana">All these designs are going to be on display at the Blind Relief Mela coming up in April.&nbsp;</font></p><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><p><font size="2" face="Verdana"> <a href="#top"><img src="../graphics/top.gif" alt="Top" align="right" border="0" hspace="0" width="35" height="35"></a> </font></p> </td>
