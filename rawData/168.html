The direction was given on February 2 asking the owners to stop such activities on their own within 30 days of the direction.

A BJP MP, two entrepreneurs and one Guddu Pandit are allegedly involved in the fraud. A report was previously lodged with the Sector 24 police here in this connection. </font></p><p><font size="2" face="Verdana">After getting the fake letter, the Noida Authority has also filed a report in this connection. A group of commission agents with the help of the MP had reportedly taken the DLF management for a ride by offering to get them a big plot allotted in the institutional area. Surinder Singh Pahwa, an agent, had contacted certain property agents of Noida. Alok, a dealer, had assured the DLF managers in the presence of the MP that a plot would be allotted to them.</font></p><p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The DLF officials and their agent, Pahwa, and Guddu Pandit and three others close to him had introduced them to another entrepreneur. This agent also runs a school on the Expressway. The DLF agreed to pay them Rs 11 crore on clinching the deal.</font></p><p><font size="2" face="Verdana">On March 21, a fake allotment letter from the Noida Authority was handed over to Pahwa and the DLF authorities. Soon after, the amount of Rs 11 crore was delivered to the property agents.</font></p><p><font size="2" face="Verdana">According to reliable sources, Guddu Pandits friend entrepreneur, pretending to be a DLF officer, tried to meet the Noida Authority chief at 9 pm on March 21 at his residence. Mr Sanjiv Saran had refused to meet him. At 11 pm, someone from the DLF reportedly called him up to thank him for allotting 15-acre land to the DLF. </font></p><p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Reprimanding him, Mr Saran reportedly told him no such plot had been allotted. Later, the Noida Chief Executive Officer called the DLF advisor and acquainted him with how things stood. On learning the correct position, there was tumult and chaos in DLF. On March 22, DLF agent Surinder Singh Pahwa filed a case against Guddu Pandit at the Sector 24 police station. Three days later, one Joginder Singh also filed a report, naming Guddu Pandit and his two brothers. </font></p><p><font size="2" face="Verdana">According to sources, the police, in a raid on Guddu Pundits house, recovered Rs 2 crore in cash. The Noida Authority has also filed a case on receiving the copy of the fake letter against unknown persons. Assistant GM Vipin Gaur had supposedly signed this fake allotment letter, whereas normally such allotment letters are signed by the Desk Officer. This fake letter was issued in the name of Arvind Khanna, Executive Director, DLF Info City Developers (Noida) P Ltd. Vipin Gaur has also filed a case.</font></p><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><p><font size="2" face="Verdana"> <a href="#top"><img src="../graphics/top.gif" alt="Top" align="right" border="0" hspace="0" width="35" height="35"></a> </font></p> </td>
