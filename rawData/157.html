No wonder, parents avoid sending their wards to these schools, leading to child labour and illiteracy.

Â“The roofs of most rooms are covered by cement shades that become very hot in summer and are inefficient during the rainy season.Â”</font></p><p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Lack of teaching staff is the biggest problem faced by these schools, the survey says. To meet the shortage of teachers, two or more sections are often merged. Teachers are often used for clerical work and most are unwilling to work in schools in slums.</font></p><p><font size="2" face="Verdana">There is shortage of non-teaching staff also, the survey says. There are some schools in Jahangirpuri that do not have a permanent peon. This leads to a problem of theft and security in these schools. The low salary of sweepers is a reason for their unwillingness to work in these schools, the survey indicates. </font></p><p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Â“As the boundary walls are low, outsiders enter the schools even during school hours. They use the buildings as venue for gambling, smoking or drinking. The classrooms are not safe either because of poor construction work,Â” the survey points out.</font></p><p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Problems of improper sanitation, dirty toilets, unavailability of drinking water and electricity, absence of a Parents Teacher Association (PTA) and sports equipment have also been highlighted.</font></p><p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Â“Drop-out rate is the biggest problem. Every year 25 to 30 per cent of the children drop out because of different reasons, but the government has not paid attention,Â” it is mentioned. </font></p><p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The survey has suggested that all eight school buildings must be reconstructed at par with the new construction norms.

The society had come up with a scheme and sold dreams of flats worth Rs 34 lakh to Rs 58 lakh each in the area notified by the Noida Authority. This company had claimed to be constructing 10 towers of nine floors each whereas the company does not own even an inch of land. </font></p><p><font size="2" face="Verdana">NR Pride is a group housing project of NR Builders Pvt Ltd in Sector 47.

The company demanded 10 per cent amount as registration fee which many people are understood to have deposited.

The land of the group housing society has been shown by NR Builders as adjacent to R.S. Nursery in Sector 47.
