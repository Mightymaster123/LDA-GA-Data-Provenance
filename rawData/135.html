IDF calling up reserve units for Northern border activity.<br>"The events this morning are not terror attacks but actions of a sovereign state that attacked Israel for no reason. The Lebanese government, of which Hezbollah is a member, is trying to destabilize regional stability. Lebanon is responsible and it will bear responsibility. "These are difficult days for the state of Israel and its citizens. There are elements in the north and south that threaten our stability and challenge our stamina and determination. They will fail and pay a dear price for their actions." - Israel Prime Minister Ehud Olmert</font></i></b></p>

"The Lebanese government is responsible for the fate of the Israeli soldiers, and must take immediate action to locate them without harming them and return them to Israel," the Israeli Defense Ministry said in a statement.</font></i></b></p>
           </div><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">Jerusalem----July 12.....Israel awoke this morning to the news that residents of the northern Israel - Lebanon border town of Shtula had been wounded by a heavy barrage of Hizbullah terror Katyusha and mortar rockets. </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">The rocket which fell on a house in Shtula, sent Magen David Adom ambulances rushing to Nahariya hospital with residents of the north scurrying to air raid shelters. The Israel Defense Forces said that the attack was a Hizbullah response to Israel's early Wednesday attempted strike on top Hamas terrorist Mohammad Deif in Gaza. </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">In addition to the terror rocket attack Hezbollah is claiming that they kidnapped two IDF soldiers on the Northern Israel border. A <i>CNN</i> correspondent in Beirut has confirmed that he has heard celebratory gunfire in the streets of the Lebanon capital. Hezbollah announced the claim on Al-Manar, its television station in Lebanon, after Israel aircraft struck terrorist positions in southern Lebanon in response to rocket attacks on northern Israel communities.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">The northern border has been on high alert since IDF Operation Summer Rains began. Two weeks ago, IAF planes made low flyovers at Syrian President Bashar Assad's summer palace reportedly while he was in residence. A month and a half ago, Israel launched a massive retaliatory strike after Hizbullah fired a series of Katyushas at Israel.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">On the Southern front, in a joint IDF and ISA action early this morning, the IDF targeted a structure in the northern Gaza Strip, used as a hideout by several Hamas terrorists. The men, senior members of the Hamas terror organization, are responsible for terror attacks, including the launching of Qassam rockets. Following intelligence information regarding imminent terror attacks planned by these senior terrorists, it was decided to target them and to prevent future attacks. </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">An IDF spokesperson told the Israel News Agency that they will continue to act with determination against terrorist organizations and terror infrastructure in order to create the conditions for the return of IDF Cpl. Gilad Shalit and to stop terror attacks and the launching of rockets from Gaza towards Israel.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">As Israel tracks down the terrorists in Gaza responsible for firing rockets into civilian towns in Southern Israel, the IDF is carrying out humanitarian operations. Over the past three days, more than 2,000,000 liters of fuel and 496 tons of natural gas were transferred into the Gaza Strip through the Nahal Oz crossing.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">Israel now faces a four front war. Hezbollah and Lebanon in the North. Syria and Iran. Islamic terror cells in the West Bank and continuing action in Gaza. The Israel Defense Forces remain on high alert throughout the country. IDF reservists expect to be called up within the coming weeks. </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">A war with Hezbollah in Lebanon and fighting in the West Bank would create a high demand for reserve manpower for the IDF, while Iran and Syria would be taken out with surgical Israel Air Force and missile's strike. Operation Summer Rains in Gaza would continue on the same course as IDF tanks continue to pour into the Palestine city.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">If an all out war does occur on several fronts, the IDF is more than ready to destroy the entire terrorist infrastructure of Lebanon, Syria and Iran. Electricity and water supplies would be cut off, but only in areas where Islam terrorists are operating from. Israel does differentiate between Palestinians and Arabs who desire peace and those who are determined to "wipe Israel off the map." </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">Several analysts in Israel point out that Israel would not be acting alone against Iran, Lebanon and Syria with US military action expected to be coordinated with the IDF.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">Just days ago Hamas politburo chief Khaled Mashal held a press conference in Damascus broadcast live on al-Jazeera, al-Arabiya, and Syrian state television. The press conference was significant, not only for its content, but because it was held in a Damascus hotel: typically in the past, when Syria-based terrorist organizations took responsibility for operations, they did so from Beirut. The high profile Mashal statement from Damascus suggests that the Asad Syria regime has changed its rules of engagement from tacit to explicit support for Hamas.</font></p><p></p><p align="center"><a href="http://www.israelnewsagency.com"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>ISRAEL NEWS AGENCY</b></font></a></p><p align="right"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b><i><font color="#FF0000">Sponsored by <a href="http://www.israelpr.com">IsraelPr.com</a></font></i></b></font></p></td>
