         <p align="left"></p> 
         <p align="left">• Former Insurance Commissioner Carroll Fisher was found guilty on Wednesday of embezzlement and perjury. The jury recommended one year in prison and a fine of $10,000 for his own campaign funds and two years in prison and a fine of $10,000 for perjury. </p> 
         <p align="left">In 2004, the Oklahoma House of Representatives impeached Fisher. The State Senate came within days of holding the first ouster trial since 1965 as a result of the charges against the former Insurance Commissioner. However, shortly before the trial was to begin, Fisher resigned from office. A similar event occurred in 1975 when then Secretary of State John Rogers resigned before his impeachment trial was slated to begin.</p> 
         <p align="left">Fisher still faces trial on additional charges, according to Attorney General Drew Edmondson.</p> 
         <p align="left"><br> • KTOK Capitol Reporter Bill Bateman made news on Wednesday when he asked a Hispanic community leader to leave a State Capitol press conference. State Rep. Randy Terrill had called the press conference to discuss his bill on illegal immigration when Ed Romo began questioning the lawmaker. Although members of the public are sometimes present at such press conferences, questions are restricted to members of the media. Bateman told Roma that the event was not a debate and told him to leave. Romo refused, prompting Bateman to call DPS officers located in the Capitol. Three Highway Patrol troopers arrived shortly before the press conference ended, however no arrests were made. Other reporters said Romo later accused Bateman of being a member of the “Minutemen,” which is a civilian group formed to help patrol the border between Mexico and the United States in an effort to stop illegal immigration into this country.<br> </p>
