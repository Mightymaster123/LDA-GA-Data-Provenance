The majority of these tubewells have been bored in South Delhi areas where the water problem continues to be acute and people do not have even water to drink, sources said. </p><p>In effect, in some areas of Delhi the residents are using ground water that is not fit for human consumption. </p><p>According to a study conducted by the Central Ground Water Board (CGWB) and Central Pollution Control Board, the official said ground water in most parts of the Capital is contaminated with fluoride and nitrate and is unfit for drinking without treatment. </p><p>At least 13 per cent of the people in Delhi do not receive water everyday. In some areas of South and South-West Delhi people do not receive water at all for their household work, sources said. </p><p>According to official figures, the total demand of potable water per day in Delhi is 850 million gallon, but due to unavailability of water in sufficient quantity it is difficult for the Jal Board to meet the demand. The national Capital is fully dependent on Haryana for its water supply and in summers the matter attains serious proportions as Haryana too needs water to meet its domestic demand. </p><p>The water in South Delhi is supplied from the treatment plants in North Delhi. However, due to the long distance covered the water does not have sufficient pressure, resulting in majority of the areas going without it. Leakage in water line and illegal cuts in pipelines by slum dwellers are another reason for the residents of south Delhi citizens not getting water, a JAL Board official said.</p><p>To meet the water demand of south Delhi, the Delhi Government has constructed Sonia Vihar water treatment plant with an expenditure of Rs 900 crore. </p><p>The UP Government has to supply water for this plant from the Tehri Dam, but it has not yet been worked out. The residents of South and east Delhi will not get sufficient water until this project starts functioning, the official said.</p><p>The official said that recently the Delhi Government had discussions with Union Water Resources Minister to put pressure on UP Chief Minister Mulayam Singh Yadav for supply of water from the Tehri Dam. </p> </font><p><font size="2" face="Verdana"> <a href="#top"><img src="../graphics/top.gif" alt="Top" align="right" border="0" hspace="0" width="35" height="35"></a> </font></p> </td>

The guidelines have provided an interest rate that is equivalent to the one year fixed deposit rate of the State Bank of India. </p><p>The FIA office-bearers raised this issue with the senior officials of the power department in a meeting held here last month and sought the revision in the interest rate immediately. It is learnt that the Nigam also pays interest to the domestic consumers, but hardly anyone claims this benefit at the time of change of ownership of the meter due to lack of awareness, said sources in the department. </p> </font><p><font size="2" face="Verdana"> <a href="#top"><img src="../graphics/top.gif" alt="Top" align="right" border="0" hspace="0" width="35" height="35"></a> </font></p> </td>
