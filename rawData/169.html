Day four of the action saw agitated traders setting afire an MCD vehicle and pelting stones at its personnel in Najafgarh, injuring two of them, and police lathi charging a violent crowd in West zone.</font></p><p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The action was spread across all the 12 zones, barring Narela, with majority of the sealing being done in Karol Bagh (143), followed by 51 in Shahdara North, 48 in Rohini and 45 each in Civil Lines and Sadar Paharganj divisions.</font></p><p><font size="2" face="Verdana">In Najafgarh, MCD sealed 19 commercial properties including the popular amusement park Fun and Food Village, and took action against 36 illegal commercial establishments in Shahdara South, 35 in City, 28 in West, and six in South zone.</font></p><p><font size="2" face="Verdana">MCD officials said they faced stiff protest from traders and public in several places and made it clear that speedy, effective and smooth sealing process was possible only when the crowds are cordoned off. Acting on a Supreme Court order, the MCD has so far sealed over 1,000 illegal commercial establishments operating in residential areas. </font></p><p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The government, meanwhile, said it will seek relief from the Supreme Court for Delhiites in the wake of issuance of a notification by the Urban Development Ministry allowing mixed land use in residential areas.</font></p><p><font size="2" face="Verdana">It also dismissed any possibility of a confrontation between the Centre and the apex court as reported by a section of media and said the government will explain the position to all sections of people as well as the court.</font></p><p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The legal officers will explain the notification to the court.

They were given one month time to close their shops and making alternative arrangements. The MCD was directed to seal these shops after expiry of the dead line given by the court.</font></p><p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The BJP activists had yesterday locked the MCD office in Rajouri Garden saying that it was located in residential area, which should be closed following the High Courts direction.</font></p><p><font size="2" face="Verdana">There were minor incidents in Rajouri Garden today also.

She will resume office on April 20. </font></p><p><font size="2" face="Verdana">HUDA had auctioned 23 commercial plot sites at the rate of Rs 271 crore against the reserve price of Rs 54 crore on February 16.</font></p><p><font size="2" face="Verdana">All these 23 allottees had deposited the first installment of 15 per cent of total payment but they were not issued the allotment letters, informed an allottee. The financial institutions would not sanction the loan without the allotment letter, he lamented. He further added that they were now in a dilemma as to what to do.</font></p><p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The allotment letters of some industrial plots were to be issued before March 31 as the new revision of rates would apply on them after March 31, informed an industrial old case allottee. </font></p><p><font size="2" face="Verdana">At least 300 residential plot owners had applied for the building plan in March to start construction work and save their time-bound extension fees. Their building plans were not sanctioned due to the absence of the Estate Officer and thus these plot owners had to pay extension fees for 2007 for no fault of theirs, said Mr Rakesh Sharma, who had applied for a building plan.</font></p><p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Mr Lalit Kumar, owner of house no 767, Sector 39, informed The Tribune that he completed all formalities and deposited the required amount for taking the completion certificate on March 22. But he was told to come after April 20 when the Estate Officer rejoins duty. </font></p><p><font size="2" face="Verdana">According to the rules and regulation of the department, he cannot shift to his new house without taking the completion certificate. More than 200 completion certificates are pending in the EOs office.</font></p><p><font size="2" face="Verdana">An officer revealed that 10 cases arrive on an average every day for permission for transfer of plot and final transfer letter. </font></p><p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The time-bound court cases were another matter of serious concern, informed the officer. The files relating to financial matters ending the previous financial year 2005-06 were also pending. After great persuasion, the Administrator, Gurgaon Zone, HUDA, Mr S. P. Gupta, conceded that important files were pending in the Estate Office. He added that the Land Acquisition Officer (LAO), Mr Amardeep Singh, was given the additional charge of the EO for 3-4 days but thereafter he was relieved as work concerning land acquisition was getting affected in his department.</font></p><p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Mr Gupta elaborated that all statutory powers rested with the EO and no other officer was empowered to sign these important documents. </font></p><p><font size="2" face="Verdana">However, the department would soon appoint someone and all pending works would be sorted out on priority basis with extra staff, claimed the Administrator. The HUDA office was aware the EO was overburdened and had already demanded one more Estate Officer for Gurgaon as the city had 57 sectors, including three industrial and institutional sectors, added the officer.</font></p><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><p><font size="2" face="Verdana"> <a href="#top"><img src="../graphics/top.gif" alt="Top" align="right" border="0" hspace="0" width="35" height="35"></a> </font></p> </td>

In view of the announcement of the hike in sector rates of property, the agents and stamp vendors charged between Rs 3,000 and Rs 5,000 from each person who came for registration of property on the last day of the financial year after which the new rates would have come into effect.</font></p><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><p><font size="2" face="Verdana"> <a href="#top"><img src="../graphics/top.gif" alt="Top" align="right" border="0" hspace="0" width="35" height="35"></a> </font></p> </td>

It certainly doesnt look like the Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD) is quite up to it. </font></p><p><font size="2" face="Verdana">But then, when the Supreme Court of India tells you to do something, you just got to do it, no questions asked. Even if the order entails sealing shops and other commercial establishments functioning in residential areas of the Capital, a directive thats even more difficult to comply with than that of demolition of illegal constructions by Delhi High Court. </font></p><p><font size="2" face="Verdana">And so it was that the MCD officials commenced the shop-sealing drive at the expiry of the deadline set by the apex court. Except that it has been one exercise whose chances of success are even more dismal than the demolition drive. </font></p><p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The reasons are not hard to see. Although the inhabitants of properties targeted by the MCDs demolition squads didnt exactly sit back calmly while the bulldozers and hammers got to work, it wasnt their livelihood that was at stake, except in a few cases like MG Road. </font></p><p><font size="2" face="Verdana">But sealing shops is obviously a very different ball game altogether, because here you are talking about virtually snatching away their owners sole means to feed themselves and their families. Not surprisingly, then, last week saw huge crowds in just about every locality visited by the MCD teams, with many traders declaring their intentions to resist the sealing drive even if it meant bodily harm in the way of police intervention. </font></p><p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Its another thing that the police have been rather reluctant to pitch in so far, as various MCD teams have been complaining, despite the city police chief maintaining that that was not the case. </font></p><p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The same cannot be said of politicians. On Wednesday, two MLAs  Vijay Singh Lochhav (Mahipalpur) and Dharamdev Solanki (Palam)  turned up to oppose the drive in Mahipalpur, haranguing the MCD officials to spare a particular showroom. It couldnt be the power of votes for sure; smells more like that of money, as certain quarters alleged. </font></p><p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The dramatic statements emanating from former Delhi Chief Minister Madan Lal Khurana, on the other hand, would seem to be inspired by his longing to capture popular sentiment for a possible return to the Capitals mainstream politics. In a press conference on Thursday, he reiterated his burning desire to oppose the sealing drive even if he had to sacrifice his precious life, because the Capital was like a temple for him which he could not bear seeing being ruined like this! </font></p><p><font size="2" face="Verdana">On Friday, he threatened to undertake a fast-unto-death right outside the Prime Ministers residence and declared that the sealing drive was reminiscent of the partition days in 1947. He also led a crowd of about 1,500 agitated traders who actually tried to give the MCD a taste of its medicine by trying to seal its Zonal Office in Rajouri Garden. He was then granted his wish of being arrested, alongwith the ever-faithful Harsharan Singh Balli who, on his part, announced plans to gherao the residences of the SC judges who had ordered the sealing drive besides breaking open MCD seals on shops in Sadar Bazaar.</font></p><p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Sensing the public resentment, the MCDs Standing Committee on Friday passed a resolution to include 229 additional roads in the list of residential areas where commercial activities will be permitted. This comes in the wake of an eleventh-hour notification issued by the Urban Development Ministry to permit shops and offices on 118 roads.</font></p><p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The chances are good that the remaining traders will not give in to the MCD drive without pitched battles through next week, and one can only hope that Delhis streets dont boom with gunfire and get soaked in blood when confrontations turn really ugly, as they most likely will.</font></p><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><p><font size="2" face="Verdana"> <a href="#top"><img src="../graphics/top.gif" alt="Top" align="right" border="0" hspace="0" width="35" height="35"></a> </font></p> </td>
